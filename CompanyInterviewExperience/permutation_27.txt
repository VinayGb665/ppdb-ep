Given a string that may contain duplicates, write a function to print all permutations of given string such that no permutation is repeated in output.
Examples: 
We have discussed an algorithm to print all permutations in below post. It is strongly recommended to refer below post as a prerequisite of this post.
Write a C program to print all permutations of a given string
The algorithm discussed on above link doesnâ€™t handle duplicates.
Run on IDE
Output: 
The above code is taken from a comment below by Mr. Lazy.
Time Complexity: O(n2 * n!)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
