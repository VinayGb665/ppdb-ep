This is a model placement paper for aptitude preparation of Cognizant Technology Solutions Interview. This placement paper will cover aptitude questions that are asked in CTS recruitment drives and also strictly follows the pattern of questions asked in CTS interviews. It is recommended to solve each one of the following questions to increase your chances of clearing the CTS interview.
Solution:
The relative speed of the train to man = (125 / 10) m/s
= 25 / 2 m/s
= (25/2 * 18/5) km/hr
= 45 km/hr
Let the relative speed of the train be x km/hr.
Therefore, x-45 = 5 or x = 50 km/hr
Solution:
We know, SI = PTR/100
or, P = (SI * 100) / TR
or, P = (4016.25 * 100) / 9*5
or, P = 8925 (answer)  
Solution:
Since 20% of the votes were invalid, 80% of the votes were valid = 80% of 7500 = 6000 votes were valid
Since one candidate got 55% of the total valid votes, then the second candidate must have 45% of the votes = 0.45 * 6000 = 2700 votes
Solution:
In such type of questions, one needs to identify the type of year, i.e., whether the year is a normal year or is it a leap year.
So the year 2008 was a leap year. So, it has to have 2 odd days. The year following 2008 is 2009 so the first day of the year would be two days ahead of what it was in 2008. So 1st Jan 2009 would be a Thursday.
Solution:
According to the question,
n = 4q + 3
therefore, 2n = 8q + 6
or, 2n = 4(2q + 1 ) + 2
Thus, we get when 2n is divided by 4, the remainder is 2.
Solution:
The difference in the time of the race completion = 45 â€“ 36 = 9 sec.
So the distance covered by Bijay in 9 sec = 100/45 * 9 = 20 meters.
Therefore Aman beats Bijay by 20 meters
Solution:
Looking at the series closely we see that in each number, the difference between the first and last digit of each number is the middle number, except 751
Solution:
A group of 4 has to be selected with at least one man So this can be done in
(1 man and 3 women), (2 men and 2 women), (3 men and 1 women) and 4 men.
The number of ways in which this can be done is
(6C1 x 4C3) + (6C2 x 4C2) + (6C3 x 4C1) + (6C4)
On solving this we get 209 ways in which these combinations can be obtained.
Solution: 
The number of ways in which all the three balls would be red = 5C3 / 15C3
= 10/455 = 2/91
Solution: 
We need t first count the amount of work done in 2 days by X
X can do a piece of work in 20 days
So, in 2 days he can do = 1/20 * 2 = 1/10
Amount of work done by X, Y and Z in 1 day = 1/20 + 1/30 + 1/60 = 1/10
So, amount of work done in 3 days = 1/10 + 1/10 = 1/5
So the work will be completed in  3 * 5 = 15 days.
