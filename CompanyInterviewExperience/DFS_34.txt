Given a string of characters of length less than 10. We need to print all the alpha-numeric abbreviation of the string.
The alpha-numeric abbreviation is in the form of characters mixed with the digits which is equal to the number of skipped characters of a selected substring. So, whenever a substring of characters is skipped, you have to replace it with the digit denoting the number of characters in the substring. There may be any number of skipped substrings of a string. No two substrings should be adjacent to each other. Hence, no two digits are adjacent in the result. For a clearer idea, see the example.

The idea is to start with empty string. At every step, we have two choices.

You can see how each character can either add up to the result as a character or as a digit. This further gives rise to 2^n abbreviations at the end where n is the length of string.
