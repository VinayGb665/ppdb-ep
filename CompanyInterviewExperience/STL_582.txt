What is Vector of Pairs?
A pair is a container which stores two values mapped to each other, and a vector containing multiple number of such pairs is called a vector of pairs.
Run on IDE
Output:
 
Case 1 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of first element of pairs in ascending order.
This type of sorting can be achieved using simple “ sort() ” function. By default the sort function sorts the vector elements on basis of first element of pairs.

Case 2 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of second element of pairs in ascending order.
There are instances when we require to sort the elements of vector on the basis of second elements of pair. For that, we modify the sort() function and we pass a third argument, a call to an user defined explicit function in the sort() function.
