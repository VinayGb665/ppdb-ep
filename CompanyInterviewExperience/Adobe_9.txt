Round 1:
The contest was held at hackerrank. Top 20 girls were selected for intern/fte interview through Adobe Codiva.
Round 2:
This was a telephonic round. The interviewer asked about my projects in detail.
Then he gave me a puzzle- In an nxm matrix, if one starts from (0,0) then how many ways are there to reach (n-1,m-1). I was able to tell the correct solution.
Next, he gave me a coding problem to print all possible permutations of a string in my preferred language. I coded in c++.
Another was to check whether a binary tree is balanced or not.
Final coding question was to print a matrix in spiral form. Towards the end of interview, he asked me OOPs concepts â€“ polymorphism , OS concepts (Threads).
AfterÂ a week I got a mail that I was selected ðŸ™‚
