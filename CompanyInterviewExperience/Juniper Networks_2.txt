Given two overlapping rectangles on a plane. We are given bottom left and top right points of the two rectangles. We need to find the total area (Green and pink areas in below diagram).

We basically add areas of two rectangles. This includes intersecting part twice, so we subtract area of intersecting part.
Area of  Rectangle = x_distance  *  y_distance 
Where,
x_distance for 1st rectangle = abs(l1.x – r1.x)
y_distance for 1st rectangle = abs(l1.y – r1.y)
Similarly, we can compute area of 2nd rectangle.
For area of intersecting part,
x_distance for intersecting rectangle =
          min(r1.x, r2.x) – max(l1.x, l2.x)
y_distance for 1st rectangle =
           min(r1.y, r2.y) – max(l1.y, l2.y)
