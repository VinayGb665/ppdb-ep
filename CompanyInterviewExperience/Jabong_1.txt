Before inviting for F2f rounds I was given a online coding test, which had standard PS/DS problems. After that I was invited for a day long drive at their Bangalore office(Myntra office.). It’s a small team of 30 people here at Bangalore.
I was given time of 9:30 a.m. but my first round happened at 1:30 p.m. and I was done with my 4th round by 9:30 p.m.
First round-
This was taken by a senior software engineer. 1 question asked.
1. Print all numbers less than n, with the fact that absolute difference between any adjacent digits should be 1.for e.g. 12, 21, 34, 43….121,12321. It took me almost 45 minutes to device the algorithm and code. 
Second Round-
This was taken by a senior person with almost 15 years of experience. 3 questions asked.
1. Design fraud detection system in any e-commerce site.
2. Coin change problem, just the algorithm.
3. Count numbers < n having 0 digit present in it.
Third Round-
This was taken by Architect.
This was more of a discussion on my past work, experience and the ‘why’ questions. For e.g. why this technology over that? 
Final Round(HR)-
General Compensation, HR typical questions.
I did not get an offer despite it went well. They do not provide feedback.
