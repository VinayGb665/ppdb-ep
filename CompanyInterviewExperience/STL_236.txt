What is Vector of Tuple?
A tuple is an object that can hold a number of elements and a vector containing multiple number of such tuple is called a vector of tuple. The elements can be of different data types. The elements of tuples are initialized as arguments in order in which they will be accessed.

Different ways to sort vector of tuples
Case 1 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of first element of tuples in Descending order.
For these instances, we modify the sort() function and we pass a third argument, a call to an user defined explicit function in the sort() function.

Case 2 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of second element of tuples in descending order.
There are instances when we require to sort the elements of the vector on the basis of second elements of tuples. For that, we modify the sort() function and we pass the third argument, a call to a user-defined explicit function in the sort() function.

Case 3 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of third element of tuples in descending order.
There are instances when we require to sort the elements of the vector on the basis of third elements of tuples. For that, we modify the sort() function and we pass the third argument, a call to a user-defined explicit function in the sort() function.
