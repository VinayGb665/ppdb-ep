DAY 2: (Interview Rounds)
Round 1 (Technical Interview – 1 hr. approx.)
The Interview started with the interviewer telling me that we don’t have much time so he will ask few questions on data structures and algorithms and I will need to tell him the approach.
Round 2 (Technical Interview – 45mins. approx.)
The interviewer introduced himself briefly and asked me to introduce myself. No follow up questions from the introduction (although I was hoping something on projects or company :P).
Round 3 (Technical Interview –  45 mins. approx.)
The interviewer introduced himself briefly and asked me to introduce myself. No follow up questions from the introduction again.
He gave me a string based question and asked me if I knew it already (which I didn’t), so he asked me to come up with an approach.
Round 4 (Technical Interview – 25mins. approx.)
Short round as it was my last round.
Only one question:
ALL THE BEST :):)
