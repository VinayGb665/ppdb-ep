Round 3:
It was a technical round which started from introducing myself. Then they discussed about my resume. Next they asked OOPâ€™s and Database concepts. They asked me to write SQL queries like finding the second highest in a table, string matching queries etc. They asked questions from linked lists like check palindrome https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-to-check-if-a-singly-linked-list-is-palindrome/
and from trees like level order traversal, top view of a binary tree etchttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/level-order-tree-traversal/https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-top-view-binary-tree/
Round 4:
This was also a technical round. They asked about projects and internships done so far. Then they discussed about Database Concepts like joins, normalisation, views, triggers etc.They also asked about various searching and sorting algorithms. This was a considerably short round duration wise.
Round 5:
This was similar to an HR round. He asked me to introduce myself and asked a few puzzles. This was a simple round and was mostly about my reaction towards different situations.
At last I was fortunate enough to be selected.
