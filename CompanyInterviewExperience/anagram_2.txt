Given N strings. Find the longest possible subsequence from each of these N strings such that they are anagram to each other. The task is to print the lexicographically largest subsequence among all the subsequences. 
Examples:
Input: s[] = { geeks, esrka, efrsk }
Output: ske
First string has “eks”, Second string has “esk”, third string has “esk”. These three are anagrams. “ske” is lexoigrapically large. 
Input: string s[] = { loop, lol, olive }
Output: ol
Approach :
