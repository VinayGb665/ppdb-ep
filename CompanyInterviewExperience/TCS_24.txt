There were two rounds in the selection process:
Round 1: First round was an online test which consisted of 4 sections:
Round 2: This was the Technical and HR round:
There were 3 interviewers in my panel, one was a lady and two gentlemen. They mostly asked me everything from what I spoke and my resume. The first question was to introduce myself. In which I included all my projects and internships done.  After this, he asked me a few questions about TCS. Like in what all sectors has it excelled, the current CEO and Chairman. Then he started asking me about my projects. He asked me how did I follow the SDLC life cycle in my project. He asked me which programming language do I prefer? He asked me a few questions on computer networks. And at the end, he asked me to explain my project on a piece of paper.
It was a very normal interview. Only thing I would say is to be confident and do a thorough research on the company before attending the interview. This shows your interest towards the company.
