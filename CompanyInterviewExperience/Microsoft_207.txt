Following questions were asked in the second round of telephonic interview:
1. Asked about some questions related to Design patterns.
2. Find a loop in linked list
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/detect-and-remove-loop-in-a-linked-list/
3. Length of the loop
Soln: Once the loop is detected, keep the slow pointer as it is, but move the fast pointer with a count variable until it reaches the slow pointer.
4. Variation of find a largest sum of contiguous array
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/
5. Given two nodes in a graph, check if they are connected or not. Pre processing can be done but the result should be computed real quick
Soln: Create a hash map with key as a single node and value as a list of all connected nodes
