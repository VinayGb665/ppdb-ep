Given a string str, we need to print reverse of individual words.
Examples:

Method 1 (Simple): Generate all words separated by space. One by one reverse words and print them separated by space. 
Method 2 (Space Efficient): We use a stack to push all words before space. As soon as we encounter a space, we empty the stack.
