Hello Geeks, I had interview in amazon few days before. I’m sharing you my experience. It was for SDE-I Profile for Hyderabad(India) location.
Round 1: Online Coding(Interviewstreet)
Q1.  Print the nth largest node of the given BST. In this question you          will have to write a function. 
Q2.  Convert the BST into sorted doubly linked list. In this question also you will have to write a function.
Q3 & Q4 was simple algorithm based.
Round 2: Telephonic Interview-I
Q1.  Given Matrix, and co-ordinates of sub-matrix of given matrix find sum.
Q2.  Given a linked list reverse every n chunks.
                 EG:   1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6…n = 3
                Output: 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4…
later they extended this Question…If there is only one node and give many conditions.
Round 3:   Telephonic Round-II
Q1.  Design a data structure for insertion, deletion & get minimum       element in O(1)time complexity? Implement the same.
Q2.  Given a Binary Search Tree and two nodes find parent node which is parent of both nodes in a given binary search tree. Later the they extended it to simple binary tree. 
Round 4:   F2F-I
Q1. Is given n-ary tree is Sum tree or not? implement function…
Q2. find Nth largest element in an array
Round 5: F2F-II
            Q1. Vertical traversal Order of tree(implement it).
            Q2. Lots of discussion on project.
Round 6: F2F-III
             Q1. Given a circular array and a pointer find the given element in the array.
             Q2. Lots of discussion on current company & company’s work.
Round 7: F2F-IV
            Explain:
              1. Customer Producer problem,
              2. Semaphore
              3. Deadlock how to solve it. 
Q: Favorite Sorting Algorithm.why,where to use it? and various question on  the sorting algorithm which I answered.
Every time they ask for time complexity for code. Ask to optimize my solution.
