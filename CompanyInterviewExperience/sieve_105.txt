Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n.
Examples:
We have discussed Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for the above task.  
Below is Sieve of Sundaram algorithm.
Below is the implementation of above algorithm :

Illustration:
All red entries in below illustration are marked entries.  For every remaining (or black) entry x, the number 2x+1 is prime.
Lets see how it works for n=102, we will have the sieve for (n-2)/2 as follows:

Mark all the numbers which can be represented as i + j + 2ij

Now for all the unmarked numbers in the list, find 2x+1 and that will be the prime:
Like 2*1+1=3
2*3+1=7
2*5+1=11
2*6+1=13
2*8+1=17 and so on..
How does this work?
When we produce our final output, we produce all integers of the form 2x+1 (i.e., they are odd) except 2 which is handled separately.
