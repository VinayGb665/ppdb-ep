Given a MxN matrix where each element can either be 0 or 1. We need to find the shortest path between a given source cell to a destination cell. The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1.
Expected time complexity is O(MN).
For example –
The idea is inspired from Lee algorithm and uses BFS.
Below is C++ implementation of the idea –
