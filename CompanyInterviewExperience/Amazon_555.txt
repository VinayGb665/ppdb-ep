I finished interviews at Amazon few days back. Here is my interview experience:
Telephonic round (Screening):
1) Discussion around work in current company. Why Amazon?
2) You are given an infinite sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1. Find the transition point efficiently.
3) He gave me some function and asked me to arrive at the complexity of it.
F2F-I:
1) Brief discussion on work in current company
2) Flatten linked list – https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/flatten-a-linked-list-with-next-and-child-pointers/
3) Design a data structure which holds number 1 to n such that insert, remove(this operation will take in a number between 1 to n as argument and remove that number from data structure if it exists) and get valid element in the data structure operations are done with O(1) complexity

F2F-2:
1) Brief discussion of work in current company
2) Find and print longest consecutive number sequence in a given sequence 
3) A fair die is thrown k times. What is the probability of sum of k throws to be equal to a number n? 
F2F-3:
1) Brief discussion of work in current company. Why Amazon?
2) Why do you want to leave current company? What do you like most and dislike most about your current company?
3) Sum two numbers represented by linked list iteratively and recursively.
4) You are given an infinite sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1. Find the transition point efficiently.
F2F-4:
1) Lots of HR, behavioral and team fit questions
2) User statistics are logged in the following format –
