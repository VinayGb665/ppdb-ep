Hello everyone, Exl Analytics recently visited our college for their campus recruitment. So I would like to share my experience as it might be helpful for your preparation. 
1st Round : Online Written Test (on CoCubes)
    20 Questions Aptitude (Data interpretation, Numbers, HCF LCM , probability and other common topics
                                                 from Quant most from Data interpretation)
                                                 10 Question from Reasoning like sitting arrangement etc.
                                                 10 Questions from Verbal English
                                                 So total 40 Questions to be done in 45 minutes
                                                 Difficulty level was high
2nd Round : Technical Round       
              Question basically from resume u hav prepared languages u hav mentioned in that
                                                 and Project discussion and your role in that.
                                                 (Not so difficult to crack)
3rd Round : HR            
                      Basic HR questions sometimes puzzels may be asked .The main focus on your approach
                                                 to solve the question not on result. Good communication will be an advantage.
Thatâ€™s it. Most difficult round in my opinion is Written round.  Best of luck guys.
