No objective questions.
Two coding questions only. We have to complete the function only.
Ques:
Given a mxn grid, each of it’s element be either ‘.’, ‘R’, ‘G’ or ‘B’,
where ‘.’ -> empty, ‘R’ -> Red, ‘G’ -> Green, ‘B’ -> Blue
A Blue strip has width 1 and length greater or equal to one.
A Red strip has length 1 and width greater or equal to one.
If a Red strip and a Blue strip overlaps, the overlapped portion will become ‘G’.
Find the minimum number of strips required to cover the whole grid.

Explanation:
Blue strips are vertical.
Red strips are horizontal.
Ex 1:
Only 1 vertical strip from (0,2) to (1,2). [Indexing from (0,0)]
Ex 2:
1 vertical strip from (0,2) to (2,2)
1 horizontal strip from (1,2) to (1,4)
1 horizontal strip from (3,0) to (3,0)
1 horizontal strip from (4,0) to (4,0)
so total — 4
Ex 3:
1 vertical strip from (0,2) to (2,2)
1 horizontal strip from (1,2) to (1,4)
1 vertical strip from (3,0) to (4,0)
1 horizontal strip from (4,4) to (4,4)
1 vertical strip from (4,4) to (4,4)
so total — 5
