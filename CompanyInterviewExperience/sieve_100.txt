A palindromic prime (sometimes called a palprime) is a prime number that is also a palindromic number. 
Given a number n, print all palindromic primes smaller than or equal to n. For example, If n is 10, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7′. And if n is 20, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7, 11′.
Idea is to generate all prime numbers smaller than or equal to given number n and checking every prime number whether it is palindromic or not.
