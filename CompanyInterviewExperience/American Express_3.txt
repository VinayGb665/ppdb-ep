Company is very much gender biased. What I feel.
This is my and my friendâ€™s perceptionÂ  This is what we felt and the stats confirm the fact. We gave our interviews quite well and we were recommended. Still not accepted by the company. What to say next guys, you have your own minds and you are free to think about the company yourself! ðŸ™‚
