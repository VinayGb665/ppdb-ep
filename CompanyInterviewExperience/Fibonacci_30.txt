Given a number ‘n’, write a function that prints the last two digits of n-th (‘n’ can also be a large number) Fibonacci number.
Examples:


A simple solution is to find n-th Fibonacci number and print its last two digit. But N can be very large, so it wouldn’t work. 
A better solution is to use the fact that after 300-th Fibonacci number last two digits starts repeating.
1) Find m = n % 300.
2) Return m-th Fibonacci number.
