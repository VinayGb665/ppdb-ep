Was called through a referral from a friend already working there.

Round 1 (Telephonic)
-Tell me about yourself
-Explain one of your projects
-questions on pointers and a long list was given comprising of binaries 0/1 in random order . The task was to achieve longest possible alternating sequence possible without using extra space. I gave a solution in quadratic time then optimized to linear.
-Question on stack, reversing a string without using for loop and reversing a stack without using auxiliary space.
-Included few more questions but don’t remember them
-Interview went for 1 hour.
After 1 week I was given a call and asked to come down to their office for interviewing.
I reached at 12 and had about 5 rounds of an hour each

Round 2(on-site)
-Tell about yourself
-had some discussion on projects i had done through out bachelors and masters
-was given a list of numbers had to find the number which occurs twice in the list
-One scenario in which a reporting of alarm happens each time the memory occupied by a process crosses some mark, had to minimize the number of alarms reported as it would not be feasible alarming the user each time the memory was above threshold(using patterns).
-given a number of digits finding the next possible maximum number using those digits

Round 3
-Tell about yourself
-Jumped to questions had to find the number which occurred only once(others occurred twice and consecutively) in a given list of numbers ,did it in linear tried for sub linear solution finding a solution.
Some use cases for testing scenario
Given a complex database make testing scenarios so as to ascertain the durability of the database.(had to deal with finding possible shortcomings in the system)

Round 4
-Tell about yourself
-Implement Stacks using single queue
-Given a string, find number of strings using ‘n’ distinct alphabets eg. given aabb and n=2, answer=aab, abb, ab and aabb
-Some more questions on string permutation and combination
– Asked oops concepts and compare java with c++
-Asked a few questions on Unix scripting

Round 5
-Tell about yourself
-given a list of size n find should have numbers from 1-n, but a number occurs twice and other number doesn’t occur. Find both the numbers in linear time.
-A leaf grows twice the size it is yesterday.how many days would it cover half the pond, given the number of days in which it covers the whole pond.
-A few more questions in do not remember
-I was comfortable in Java so asked concepts of java here and there and other oops concepts

Round 6 HR (Finally 7:00 pm)
-was given a task to make a placement portal what technologies would you use I answered it using html, css and php etc
