The atan2() is an inbuilt function in C++ STL which returns tangent inverse of (y/x), where y is the proportion of the y-coordinate and x is the proportion of the x-coordinate. The numeric value lies between – and  representing the angle  of a (x, y) point and positive x-axis. It is the counterclockwise angle, measured in radian, between the positive X-axis, and the point (x, y). 
Syntax:
Parameters:The function accepts two mandatory parameters which are decribed below: 
The parameters can be of double, float or long double datatype. 
Return Value: The function returns a numeric value between – and  representing the angle  of a (x, y) point and positive x-axis. It is the counterclockwise angle, measured in radian, between the positive X-axis, and the point (x, y).
