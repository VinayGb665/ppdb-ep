Persistent system came to our campus for recruitment. I faced so many problems before the interview because i searched a lot about the interview process and type of question asked in the written paper as well as in the interviews in persistent sys but I didn’t find anything about it, meanwhile my seniors helped me a lot. Hope that my experience would be definitely help u in all the selection process. 
First Round Written Test:-

A simple data structure question was asked ,need to write full code for it.If u got selected in the objective paper only then coding paper would be checked.

Resume is very important. You should prepare each and every point that is written in the resume and fell free there, dont be nervous. Show your confidence . Always remember “they r here for your selection,not for your rejection”.All the very best 🙂
