Given two numbers x and y, and a range [l, r] where 1 <= l, r <= 32.  The task is consider set bits of y in range [l, r] and set these bits in x also.

Method 1 (One by one copy bits)
We can one by one find set bits of y by traversing given range.  For every set bit, we OR it to existing bit of x, so that the becomes set in x, if it was not set.  Below is C++ implementation.
