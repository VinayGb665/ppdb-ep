Written Round:
   There were 21 mcqs and 2 coding questions hosted on hackkerank.
Time: 1 hr 30 mns.
  The mcqs were from c, c++, os, networks for example
 1. LDAP stands for ?
 2. 2^30+2^30+2^30+2^30 = ?
 3. Given three process P, Q, R . P requests resources A, B, C, Q requests B, C, D and R requests C, D, A which of the following orders is deadlock free
 4. Given a postfix expresion find the value of expresion
 5. Which of the following is the inorder traversal for the given pre order traversal
 6  Question based on the precedence order of operators
Coding questions:
1) Given a graph. Find if a cycle exists and print the nodes in the cycle. If multiple cycles exists print the cycle starting from the lowest index
2) Given a string S and a string T, count the number of distinct subsequences of T in S.
S = “rabbbit”, T = “rabbit”

Interview 1:
1) Find the diameter in given tree which can start at any node and can end
  at any node and should have only single turn. 
10-45-10-56-45 has 1 turn
20-45-10-56  has 2 turns
