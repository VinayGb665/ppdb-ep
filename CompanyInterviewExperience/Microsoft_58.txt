Given a number n (number of variables) and val (sum of the variables), find out how many such non negative integral solutions are possible.   
Examples : 
Asked in: Microsoft Interview 

1. Make a recursive function call to countSolutions(int n, int val)
2. Call this Solution function countSolutions(n-1, val-i) until n = 1 and val >=0 and then return 1.
