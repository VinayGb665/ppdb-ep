A permutation, also called an “arrangement number” or “order,” is a rearrangement of the elements of an ordered list S into a one-to-one correspondence with S itself. A string of length n has n! permutation.

Algorithm Paradigm: Backtracking
Time Complexity: O(n*n!)  Note that there are n! permutations and it requires O(n) time to print a a permutation.
Note : The above solution prints duplicate permutations if there are repeating characters in input string. Please see below link for a solution that prints only distinct permutations even if there are duplicates in input.
Print all distinct permutations of a given string with duplicates.
