Qualcomm visited our campus to hire software interns. The process had three rounds.
Round 1: Logical reasoning and Technical test
In this round, there were 60 questions that had to be completed in 60 minutes. Out of the 30 questions, 20 were logical reasoning aptitude questions and 10 were technical questions(code output, debugging, DBMS, OS, networking etc.). Around 40 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2: Coding test
This round had 2 coding questions which had to be done in 3 hours. Again, this test was on their own platform. Also, the interesting part of this test was, browsing the internet to solve questions was allowed. The questions were practical problems rather than standard coding questions.
The first question was based on string formatting. It was for 50 points.
The second question was to parse given lines of code that are written in a new language whose syntax and rules were given in the question and processing the code to generate the corresponding output. It was for 150 points.
They shortlisted 6 students for the next round.
Round 3: F2F Interview 
This round took place in their Noida office.
