Binary Search is a searching technique used to search an element in a sorted array. In this article, we will learn about how to implement Binary Search in PHP using iterative and recursive way. Given a array of numbers, we need to search for the presence of element x in the array using Binary Search.
Examples:

This searching technique is more efficient than linear search.
Method 1(Iterative):
Steps Involved:
1) Sort the array as binary search only works on sorted ranges
2) Compute the middle element if the element we wish to search is greater than the middle element search on the right side else search on the left.
3) Return True if the element is found.

Method 2(Recursive):
Recursion is a way where we repeatedly call the same function until a base condition is matched to end the recursion.
Proceeding with the steps in method 1 here we use the same idea by just changing the parameters of the function in recursive manner and breaking down the problem.
