Given two numbers  and . The task is to find the sum of the sequence given below.
(1*2*3*…*k) + (2*3*…*k*(k+1)) + (3*4*..*(k+1)*(k+2)) +…..+((n-k+1)*(n-k+2)*…*(n-k+k)).
Since the output can be large, print the answer under modulo 10^9+7.
Examples:
Let us take the given example and try to reduce it to a general formula.
In the given example for n = 3 and k=2,
We know that:

So each term is of the form: 
      
If we multiply and divide by , it becomes 
      
Which is nothing but,

Therefore,

But since n is so large we can not calculate it directly, we have to simplify the above expression.
On Simplifying we get,
      
Below is the implementation of the above idea:
