Given an array of distinct integers, the task is to find two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) such that ab = cd, where a, b, c and d are distinct elements.
Examples:

A Simple Solution is to run four loops to generate all possible quadruples of array element. For every quadruple (a, b, c, d), check if a*b = c*d. Time complexity of this solution is O(n4).
An Efficient Solution of this problem is to use hashing. We use product as key and pair as value in hash table.

Time Complexity : O(n2) assuming hash search and insert operations take O(1) time.
