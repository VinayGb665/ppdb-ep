Consider n machines which produce same type of items but at different rate i.e., machine 1 takes a1 sec to produce an item, machine 2 takes a2 sec to produce an item. Given an array which contains the time required by ith machine to produce an item. Considering all machine are working simultaneously, the task is to find minimum time required to produce m items.
Examples:

Method 1 : (Brute Force)
Initialize time = 0 and increment it by 1. Calculate number of item produce at each time until number of produced items is not equal to m.

Method 2 (efficient):
The idea is to use Binary Search. Maximum possible time required to produce m items will be maximum time in the array, amax, multiplied by m i.e amax * m. So, use binary search between 1 to amax * m and find the minimum time which produce m items.
