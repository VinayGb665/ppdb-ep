Amazon visited our campus. It started with a online coding round and followed by one telephonic and then 3 face to face interview and again a telephonic interview. All interview rounds started with brief introduction about me.
Round 1(Online Coding Round): 
Asked 2 coding question and 20 mcq from Computer science fundamentals (OS, DS, DBMS, Networks etc.) 
1) Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1,      compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

2) Check whether two strings are anagram of each other.

Round 2 (Telephonic round):
1) Tell me about yourself.
2) Vertical Sum in a given Binary Tree

3) Project Discussion
Round 3 (f2f onsite): 
1) Tell me about yourself.
2) Sort a linked list of 0s, 1s and 2s

3) Find duplicates in O(n) time and O(1) extra space.

Round 4 (f2f onsite):
1)  Design a data structure that supports insert, delete, search and getRandom in constant time

3) lca of k nodes in given bst 
4)  Kâ€™th largest element in a stream

Round 5 (f2f onsite): 
1)  Floor and Ceil from a BST

2)  Find the two numbers with odd occurrences in an unsorted array

4) Project Discussion
Round 6 (Telephonic round): 
1) Tell me about yourself.
2) Most proudest moment in last one year.
3) Most regretted moment in last one year.
4) Asked about what data structure and alogithms did i know then asked what is segment tree.
5) Reverse the stack using recursion

7) Project Discussion
Really want to thanks geeksforgeeks for providing great platform for learning.
