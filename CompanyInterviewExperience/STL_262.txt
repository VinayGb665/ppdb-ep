Associative arrays are also called map or dictionaries.  In C++. These are special kind of arrays, where indexing can be numeric or any other data type
i.e can be numeric 0, 1, 2, 3..  OR character a, b, c, d… OR string  geek, computers…
These indexes are referred as keys and data stored at that position is called
value.
So in associative array we have (key, value) pair.
We use STL maps to implement the concept of associative arrays in C++.

Example:
Now we have to print the marks of computer geeks whose names and marks are as follows
