Write a program to find the sum of fourth powers of the first n natural numbers 14 + 24 + 34 + 44 + …….+ n4 till n-th term.
Examples :
Naive Approach :-  Simple finding the fourth powers of the first n natural numbers is iterate a loop from 1 to n time. like suppose n=4.
(1*1*1*1)+(2*2*2*2)+(3*3*3*3)+(4*4*4*4) = 354

Time Complexity : O(n)
 Efficient Approach :- An efficient solution is to use direct mathematical formula which is 1/30n(n+1)(2n+1)(3n2+3n+1) or it is also write (1/5)n5 + (1/2)n4 + (1/3)n3 – (1/30)n. This solution take O(1) time.
