I received interview call from amazon.com (Bangalore) for SDE1 position for 1.5 year experience. 
Round 1: 1 hour â€“ written test at amazon office.
Q1. Given a set of strings, find the alphabets common to all strings.
Â Â Â Â       <I used Hashmaps>
Q3. Longest Palindronic subsequence in a given string.
Â Â Â Â        <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-12-longest-palindromic-subsequence/>
Q3. Find LCA of two nodes in a binary tree
 Â Â Â Â          <https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lowest-common-ancestor-binary-tree-set-1/>
Round 2: F2F 1.5 hour 
Given a huge file with large number of words, code a function that would take a word as input and print all anagrams of that word present in the file as output. Function has to be really really fast alsmo O(1) run time. You are allowed to take as much time and resources for pre processing the file once. But after pre-processing function should perform in O(1) time.
<Use hashmap, and fact that all anagrams have similar alphabetical order of letters>
Create a hash function for above.
He then asked, another way instead of Hash ?

How to optimize searching among this linked list of heads of other linked lists.

Round 3: F2F 1 hour
Only one question â€“ Print leftmost and rightmost node at every level of binary tree.

Round 4: F2F 1 hour
Given a string with some â€˜?â€™ where ? can be 0 or 1. Print all possible strings by substituting ? with 0/1.
Eg: I/p Amaz??n,
Â Â Â Â         o/p Amaz00n, Amaz10n, Amaz01n, Amaz11n

Connect all nodes of a binary tree which are at same level.
<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/>
<I used level order traversal, with extra variable level>
Round 5: Telephonic 1.5 hour
Write a code (online shared collab document) to check whether a tree satisfies children-sum property.
<https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-for-children-sum-property-in-a-binary-tree/>
Write a code (online shared collab document) to convert a given tree to a tree that satisfies children-sum property.

Round 6: F2F 1 hour

Top 3 features I would put on a website portal if Iâ€™m launching a cab service. (Non-technical)
Write  code for scheduling algorithms for such a cab services provided you have a list of future bookings, and list of cabs in your fleet.
<I was asked to write OOP paradigm code>
Tips:
 Try to interact continuously with interviewer. Keep thinking aloud and keep discussing with interviewers your ideas and approaches
 Prepare Data structures, in particular binary tree very thoroughly.
Hope this helps. ðŸ™‚
