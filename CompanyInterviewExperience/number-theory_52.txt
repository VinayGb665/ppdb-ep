A perfect power is a number that can be expressed as power of another positive integer. 
Given a number n, find count of numbers from 1 to n that are of type xy where x >= 1 and y > 1
Examples :
A simple solution is to go through all powers of numbers from i = 2 to square root of n.

Efficient Solution 
We divide output set into subsets.
Even Powers : Simply we need to square root n. The count of even powers smaller than n is square root of n.  For example even powers smaller than 25 are (1, 4, 9, 16 and 25).
Odd Powers : We modify above function to consider only odd powers.
