My friend in Amazon referred me for the job . I was approached by the HR and after lots of delay (1 month), I was scheduled a Telephonic Interview.
Round 1: (Telephonic Interview ) – 1h 
A screen was shared (Notepad) where I will be writing codes and doing other rough work. I was doing conversation with him on phone.
The interviewer was pretty impressed by my coding skills but not so much with my testing skill (I guess :P). Anyways, I got the call for my next rounds. There were four of them at Hyderabad itself. Amazon took care of all the travelling and stay (Awesome nah :D)
Round 2: (Software development Manager 1 ) : 45 mins
Asked questions like:
Round 3: (Software development Manager 2) : 1h
Asked questions like:
Round 3: (Software development Engineer) : 1h
Asked coding questions (Nailed it AF):
Round 4: (Quality Assurance Engineer) : 1h
Well, Guess what, I was not selected for the role. They were quite impressed by my coding skills and not so much with my testing skills. Fair enough !
Tips for Aspirants: Study geeks well (mostly the Data structures part and in Algo mostly the DP part). Go through other interview experience of Amazon . https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/amazon-interview-preparation/  For testing, I don’t have much idea.
