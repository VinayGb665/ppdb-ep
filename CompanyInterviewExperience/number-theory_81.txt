Given a number n, the task is to find the even factor sum of a number.
Examples:

Prerequisite : Sum of factors
As discussed in above mentioned previous post, sum of factors of a number is
Let p1, p2, … pk be prime factors of n. Let a1, a2, .. ak be highest powers of p1, p2, .. pk respectively that divide n, i.e., we can write n as n = (p1a1)*(p2a2)* … (pkak).
If number is odd, then there are no even factors, so we simply return 0.
If number is even, we use above formula.  We only need to ignore 20.  All other terms multiply to produce even  factor sum.  For example, consider n = 18. It can be written as 2132 and sun of all factors is (20 + 21)*(30 + 31 + 32). if we remove 20 then we get the
Sum of even factors (2)*(1+3+32) = 26.
To remove odd number in even factor, we ignore then 20 whaich is 1. After this step, we only get even factors. Note that 2 is the only even prime.
Below is the implementation of the above approach.
