HSBC came to our college for SDE profile Hiring.
1st Round:
Four Coding Questions to be done in 2 hours;
1. Quick Sort on Doubly linked list
2. Sort n numbers in range from 0 to 2^n-1 in linear time
3. Find length of longest consecutive path from a given string character.
4. Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can performed on str1. Find minimum number of edits (operations) required to convert ‘str1? into ‘str2?.
After 1 hour results were announced. Among 80 students of CS/IT, they shortlisted 7 of us. The people who were able to do 3 or more codes were shortlisted.
2nd Round: 
Technical Round (Very Tough )
1. what does space complexity means?
2. What is Dijkastra Shortest path Algorithm.
3. The Activity selection problem- full working code
4. K centres Problem- – full working code
5. Prims MST for adjacency list representation- – full working code
6. Given a string ‘str’ of digits, find length of the longest substring of ‘str’, such that the length of the substring is 2k digits and sum of left k digits is equal to the sum of right k digits.- – full working code
7. Given a string, find the longest substring which is palindrome.- full working code
    if the given string is “forgeeksskeegfor”, the output should be “geeksskeeg”
    if the given string is “abaaba”, the output should be “abaaba”
    if the given string is “abababa”, the output should be “abababa”
    if the given string is “abcbabcbabcba”, the output should be “abcbabcba
