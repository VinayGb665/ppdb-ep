Round 2:technical interview
He asked me if i’m comfortable with mysql and later shifted to data structures
I told by using 2 variables we’ll maintain the count and later just overwrite the array, he asked me to solve it in one traversal of array, then i told him have two pointers one from starting and other from end and as soon as we find the first 1 from left and first 0 from right swap them, (similar to quick sort) and do like this until both the pointers meet
