The classical Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm takes O(N log (log N)) time to find all prime numbers less than N. In this article, a modified Sieve is discussed that works in O(N) time.
Example : 
Manipulated Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm  works as following:
Below is implementation of above idea.
