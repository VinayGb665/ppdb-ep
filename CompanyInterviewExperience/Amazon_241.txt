Given a Binary Tree find the length of the longest path which comprises of nodes with consecutive values in increasing order. Every node is considered as a path of length 1.
Examples:
We can solve above problem recursively. At each node we need information of its parent node, if current node has value one more than its parent node then it makes a consecutive path, at each node we will compare nodeâ€™s value with its parent value and update the longest consecutive path accordingly.
    For getting the value of parent node, we will pass the (node_value + 1) as an argument to the recursive method and compare the node value with this argument value, if satisfies, update the current length of consecutive path otherwise reinitialize current path length by 1.
