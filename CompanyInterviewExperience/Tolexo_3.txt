a) Standard puzzle: You have 9 coins and a weight machine.  Out of which one coins is lighter find that coins in less attempt. Note : instead of 9 coins he asked for 80 coins .
Ans is 3^4 >= 80 i.e. 4
Divide into 26,27,27 group and apply the same algo as 9 coins.
b)  There is a dark room and you have 13 head and 8 coins on a table, make a two group as number of tails coins are equal in both group. (I asked the ans to him and it was too funny when he was trying to explain and no ans)
NOTE : their main focus is on database, prepare it very well and deeply.
