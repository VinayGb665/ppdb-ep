Given two numbers, a and b. Compute the average of the two numbers.
The well know formula (a + b) / 2 may fail at the following case :
If, a = b = (2^31) â€“ 1; i.e. INT_MAX.
Now, (a+b) will cause overflow and hence formula (a + b) / 2 wont work

Improved Formula that does not cause overflow :
Average = (a / 2) + (b / 2) + (((a % 2) + (b % 2)) / 2)
