Given a string containing space-separated words and a number K. The task is to find and print all those words whose length is greater than K using stringstream in C++. 
A general solution to solve this problem using loops is discussed in the previous article. In this article, a solution using stringstream in C++ will be discussed.
Examples:
The idea is to use stringstream to create a stream by splitting the given string into tokens and then process the stream and print the words with length greater than K.
Below is the implementation of the above idea:
