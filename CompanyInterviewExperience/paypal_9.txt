Given a string and number of rows ‘n’.  Print the string formed by concatenating n rows when  input string is written in row-wise Zig-Zag fashion.
Examples: 


The idea is to traverse the input string.  Every character has to go to one of the rows.  One by one add all characters to different rows. Below is algorithm: 
Below is implementation of above idea.
