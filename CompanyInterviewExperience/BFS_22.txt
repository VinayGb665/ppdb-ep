Suppose A is at position (0, 0) of a 2-D grid containing ‘m’ rows and ‘n’ columns. His aim is to reach the bottom right point of this grid traveling through as minimum number of cells as possible.
Each cell of the grid contains a positive integer that defines the number of cells A can jump either in the right or the downward direction when he reaches that cell.
Find the minimum no of cells that need to be touched in order to reach bottom right corner.
