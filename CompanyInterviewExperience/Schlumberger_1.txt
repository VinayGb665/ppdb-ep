Round 1: He completely talked about CV. First he started with Tell me about yourself then what have you have in big data analytics project. Why you did that project (motivation). Then he gave me a small problem which needs actions and transformations knowledge of apache spark. There were 3 columns start_date,end_date,time_allowed . We have to check which work(row) took more time (end_date-start_date) than allowed time.  Next he asked me about genetic algorithm which I used in my BTP.  This is a telephonic Interview.
