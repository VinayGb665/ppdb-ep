at() function is used reference the element present at the position given as the parameter to the function.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. If the position is not present in the vector, it throws out_of_range.
2. It has a strong no exception throw guarantee otherwise.
Run on IDE
Output:
Application
Given a vector of integers, print all the integers present at even positions.
Algorithm
1. Run a loop till  the size of the vector.
2. Check if the position is divisible by 2, if yes, print the element at that position.
Run on IDE
Output:
This function is used to swap the contents of one vector with another vector of same type and size.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. It throws an error if the vector are not of the same type.
2. It throws error if the vector are not of the same size.
2. It has a basic no exception throw guarantee otherwise.
