It was a very good experience to face interview at Qualcomm.
I have attended the interview for a position of Embedded SW application developer and my experience and my expertise is on C/RTOS/Data structures in telecom domain.
Process: 1 Telephonic, 5 Technical, 1 HR round (each of 40min to 1 hr).
All rounds were not that much tough and interviewers were very friendly in talking.
Telephonic:
Note: All questions were asked deeply and need to tell him until he convinced with the answers.
After 2 days I got a call to come down to Qcom office for next rounds. That day went long..!!
Round 1: 
And further questions on that.. like why ?
Round 2:

Round 3:
Round 4:
Round 5:
Round 6 (HR):
Note: All rounds, you need to explain about your project clearly and they can ask some really good questions from project. Be out and out clear with your projects and CV.
All interviewers will explain about the position you have applied for and it is good if you ask more questions on what exactly they do and how it works.
I did these interviews very good but unfortunately I was not into the Qualcomm after this. But they considered for another position and within a month I got another call and again 3 rounds of Technical Interviews as below,
Process:  3 Technical
Round 1:
Round 2:
Round 3:
After this I was actually into my Dream Company and Happy..!!
I would sincerely Thank GeeksforGeeks very helpful in my preparation and hope this would be useful for other aspirants.
