It was very tedious process. All rounds went well but I could not figure out what went wrong. Plus there is very difference between hikes given in Delhi and Bangalore. HR don’t have clear thought about whom they want to hire and don’t even share the feedback. Wasted a lot of time in Snapdeal process.
