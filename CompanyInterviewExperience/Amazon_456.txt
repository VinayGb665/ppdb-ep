Given a string  ‘str’ of digits and an integer ‘n’, build the lowest possible  number by removing ‘n’ digits from the string and not changing the order of input digits.
Examples: 
The idea is based on the fact that a character among first (n+1) characters must be there in resultant number.  So we pick the smallest of first (n+1) digits and put it in result, and recur for remaining characters. Below is complete algorithm.
Below is C++ implementation of above algorithm.
