Given ‘num’ which indicates number of lines.The task is to print a trapezium pattern in num lines.
Examples:
Algorithm :
step 1.To read num which indicates number of lines.
step 2.We are diving pattern into 2 halves that is LHS part and RHS part.
Ex : When num = 2
LHS –
1*2*
  3*
RHS –
    5*6
    4
step 3.Combining LHS and RHS we get the complete pattern.
