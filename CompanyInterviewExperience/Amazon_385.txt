Recently Amazon visited our campus and take three rounds for final selection.
First Round: 20 MCQs, 2 Coding questions. Platform â€“ HackerRank.
Coding Questions:
1.Print all possible words from phone digits
Find possible words phone digits
2.A question involving optimization using modified binary search(I do not remember the entire question).
A total of 10 students were selected after this round.The aptitude were simple but coding questions were time-consuming.
Second Round(technical):
The interviewer asked me three questions one after another.
First question:
1.print all permutations of a given string.

The interviewer asked me the approach only.
2.print a matrix in spiral order.

The interviewer asked me directly to code.
3.print the left and right view of a binary tree.

The interviewer asked me the approach but did not tell me  to code.
It was an easy round and 5 students were selected for Third round.

Third Round(Technical):
1.Write a program to remove the whitespaces from a given string.
First i told him in o(n) time complexity and o(n) space complexity approach but he wanted o(n) time complexity with constant space complexity. I was unable to do it so he asked me second question.

2.Write a program to find the element which is common in all the rows in a two-dimensional array. I told him using binary search but he wanted more optimized approach but i was unable to do so.
I did not get selected but Overall it was a good interview experience.
I want to thank geeksforgeeks for such a good and amazing solutions to the back-breaking problems which helped me in the interview .
