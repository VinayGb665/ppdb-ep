Given a set of n nuts of different sizes and n bolts of different sizes. There is a one-one mapping between nuts and bolts. Match nuts and bolts efficiently.
Constraint: Comparison of a nut to another nut or a bolt to another bolt is not allowed. It means nut can only be compared with bolt and bolt can only be compared with nut to see which one is bigger/smaller.
Examples:
Other way of asking this problem is, given a box with locks and keys where one lock can be opened by one key in the box. We need to match the pair.
We have discussed a sorting based solution in below post.
Nuts & Bolts Problem (Lock & Key problem) | Set 1
In this post, hashmap based approach is discussed.
Run on IDE
Output:
Time complexity for this solution is O(n).
