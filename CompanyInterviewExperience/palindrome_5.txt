Given a string of lowercase characters, the task is to detect the family of string, where family of string is described as follows.
Examples:

Input : geeksforskeeg
Output : ODD Palindrome
Explanation: The string with characters at odd indices(following 1-based indexing) is ‘gesoseg‘, which is a palindrome, while the string formed by characters at even indices does not form a palindrome. Thus the given string is of ‘ODD‘ Family.
Input : aibohobia
Output : PARENT Palindrome
Explanation: The string itself is a palindrome, thus falls under PARENT Family.

Approach: Define 2 empty strings, oddString and evenString.
Now, check for the following cases:
Below is the implementation of above approach:
