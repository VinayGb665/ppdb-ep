We are given an integer N. We need to write a program to find the least positive integer X made up of only digits 9’s and 0’s, such that, X is a multiple of N.
Note: It is assumed that the value of X will not exceed 106.
Examples:
The idea to solve this problem is to generate and store all of the numbers which can be formed using digits 0 & 9. Then find the smallest number among these generated number which is divisible by N.
We will use the method of generating binary numbers to generate all numbers which can be formed by using digits 0 & 9.
Below is the implementation of above idea:
