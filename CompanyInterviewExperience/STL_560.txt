What are C style strings?
These strings are array of characters terminating with a NULL character. C style strings can be declared in following ways:
Declaration and initialization
Run on IDE
Output:
C style strings are operated with very useful functions like strcpy(), strlen(), strpbrk(), strcat(), strstr() and many more!(All these functions are member functions of ‘cstring‘ header ).  
What is a std::string?
C++ standard library contains functions and classes. String is one of its classes. Here we deal with an object of string class. This std::string takes care of itself and manages its own memory.
Declaration and initialization
Run on IDE
Output:
Converting C-String to a std::string.
But why do we need this transformation? From a C string to a std::string? It is because
And many more! Here is the code for it:-
Run on IDE
Output:
The above conversion also works for character array. 
Converting a std::string to a C style string
Why do we need this transformation? From std::string to a C string?
You can think of other reasons too!
Here is the code for conversion:-
Run on IDE
Output:
std::string also has a function c_str() that can be used to get a null terminated character array.
Run on IDE
Output:
Both C strings and std::strings have their own advantages. One should know conversion between them, to solve problems easily and effectively.
