Two dice are thrown simultaneously. What is the probability of getting two numbers whose product is even?
(A) 7/9
(B) 5/8
(C) 3/4
(D) 1/2
 Answer: (C) Explanation: Total number of outcomes = 6 * 6 = 36.
Number of favorable outcomes = (1,2/4/6), (2,1/2/3/4/5/6), (3,2/4/6), (4,1/2/3/4/5/6) (5,2/4/6), (6,1/2/3/4/5/6) = 3 + 6 + 3 + 6 + 3 + 6 = 27.
Therefore, required probability = 27/36 = 3/4.
