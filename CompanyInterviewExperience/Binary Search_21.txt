Given an unsorted array and a number x, find index of first occurrence of x when we sort the array.  If x is not present, print -1.
Examples:
A simple solution is to first sort the array, then do binary search to find first occurrence.
Run on IDE
Output : 
Time Complexity : O(n Log n)
An efficient solution is to simply count smaller elements than x.
Run on IDE
Output : 
Time Complexity : O(n)
