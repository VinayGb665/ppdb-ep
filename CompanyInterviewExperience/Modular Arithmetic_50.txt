Given an array of n integers .We need to find all ‘k’ such that  
Examples:

Suppose the array contains only two elements a and b (b>a). So we can write b = a + d where d is a positive integer and ‘k’ be a number such that b%k = a%k.  
Now what we get from the above calculation is that ‘k’ should be a divisor of difference between the two numbers.
Now what we have to do when we have an array of integers
