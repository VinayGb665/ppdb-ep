Online round:
20 MCQs on mathematics, probability, operating systems, DBMS, compilers and basic DS concepts.
Coding questions (Full code required):
1. Given an array containing zero and non-zero elements, modify the array such that it has the 0’s at the end and the non-zero elements at the beginning. Print the number of swaps required and the number of non-zero elements.
2. Given a ‘pattern’ and a ‘text’ print the indexes of ‘text’ where any anagrams of ‘pattern’ occur.

1st technical:
1. Given a linked list reverse the even nodes in one pass and in O(1) space.
So 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8 should be converted to 1->8->3->6->5->4->7->2.
2. Given an array containing integers, modify the array such that the 5’s are at the end and the rest are at the beginning (maintaining the same order).
2nd technical:
1. 5 minute discussion about my OCR project.
2. Given an undirected graph, count the number of cycles with 3 nodes.
3. What is a spanning tree? Difference from tree, if any.
4. How to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph?
5. Given an array convert it to another array such that the following condition holds:
a < b > c < d > e < f > g < h
where the modified array is {a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h}
Input:
1,2,3,4,5,6
Output:
1,3,2,5,4,6 

3rd technical:
1. What do you know about memory management in Operating Systems? What is segmentation? What is paging?
2. Design problem: Given a station with n platforms.  So each platform has one line. But these n lines join into one, after leaving the platform (on both sides). Each train has to wait a minimum of x minutes in the platform. Trains arrive from both ends. If all the platforms are occupied they wait. There is also a point beyond the end of the platform (on both sides). This point indicates that an incoming train has to wait at that point until a leaving train (from that end) passes that point. Design the whole system.
3. How are big files stored in memory? What are the uses of B-tree? How is it more useful than BST?
4. Given one billion file indexes and said that n files are missing. How would you identify the file indexes of those who are missing?

4th technical:
1. Given an array of integers. This array denotes ‘our’ own ascending order of the elements. So if the array is {2,3,1,4}, by mathematics we can say that 2<3<1<4. Given another array, sort this new array in ‘our’ ascending order.
Let’s say the new array is {1,2,4,3,5,4,9,2}, output will be {2,2,3,1,4,4,5,9}. Note that since 5 and 9 do not occur, they are sorted by actual ascending order at the end.

2. Integers are coming in a stream. A special integer (say -9999) denotes reset. Design a data structure such that when the special integer comes the previous elements are printed in a zigzag way and all the elements are deleted (reset). And then continues to accept other integers. What DS will you use?
