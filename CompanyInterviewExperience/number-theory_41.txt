Lagrange’s Four Square Theorem states that every natural number can be written as sum of squares of four non negative integers.

For eg. 
Similarly 
Similarly for any

The above identity may be derived from Euler’s four square identity: which says we can write a product of 2 numbers (which can be written as sum of 4 squares) as the sum of 4 squares.
