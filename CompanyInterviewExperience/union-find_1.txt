Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal’s algorithm

1. Sort all the edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
2. Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far. If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else, discard it.
3. Repeat step#2 until there are (V-1) edges in the spanning tree.
We have discussed one implementation of Kruskal’s algorithm in previous post. In this post, a simpler implementation for adjacency matrix is discussed.

Note that the above solution is not efficient. The idea is to provide a simple implementation for adjacency matrix representations. Please see below for efficient implementations.
