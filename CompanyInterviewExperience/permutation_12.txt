Given two strings in lowercase, find the longest string whose permutations are subsequences of given two strings. The output longest string must be sorted.
Examples:

The idea is to count characters in both strings.
Run on IDE
Output:
Time Complexity : O(m + n) where m and n are lengths of input strings.
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
