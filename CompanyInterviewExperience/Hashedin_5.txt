and one graph based question in which you are supposed to find shortest path
3 programming questions
Out of 539 student they shortlisted only 20 students for interview.
In the written test main focus is on programming questions as they want hardcore coders. So, if u have attempted 2 out of three coding questions decently then you will be shortlisted for further round.
2nd day
1. technical round ( your performance in technical round will decide whether you will have 2 technical rounds or just one )
