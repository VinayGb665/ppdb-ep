Consider a special family of Engineers and Doctors with following rules :
We can represent the situation using below diagram:
Given level and position of a person in above ancestor tree, find the profession of the person.
Examples :

Method 1 (Recursive)
The idea is based on the fact that profession of a person depends on following two. 
We recursively find the profession of parent, then use point 2 above to find the profession of current node. 
Below is implementation of above idea.

Method 2 (Using Bitwise Operators)
Level input isn’t necessary (if we ignore max position limit) because first elements are same.
The result is based on count of 1’s in binary representation of position minus one.  If count of 1’s is even then result is Engineer, else then Doctor.
And of course position limit is 2^(Level-1)

Thanks to  Furkan Uslu for suggesting this method.
