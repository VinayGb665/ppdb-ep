I got a call from amazon for F2F discussion for SDE1 at hyderabad. There were totally four rounds and asked to leave for the day.
First round:
Second Round:
Third Round:
It was a discussion on my current project and the challenges I faced and how I managed when I am unable to meet the deadlines.
Fourth Round:
It was again discussion on my current project.
Final question of my interview: Add 1 to the integer represented by a linked list with O(n) time and O(1) space.
First I start with the recursion and he suggested me without stack space too. Then I suggested for the reversing of linked list and then adding the number. He was again asked me without reversing of linked list. Then I came up with the solution with linear search.
