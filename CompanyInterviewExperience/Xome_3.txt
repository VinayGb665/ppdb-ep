Long Coding ( 2 hours)
Of the 32 students 9 were selected for the interviews. I was one among them.
Interview
1. Find the sum of all nodes greater than the given node’s value and store in the node in a BST?
(Note: this had to be done for all nodes in the BST)
2. Given two arrays find number that is present in array2 but not in array1.
3. Sort 0’s,1’s in an array.
4. Sort 0’s,1’s,2’s in an array.
5. 8 identical balls puzzle.
I did well but the reason I got rejected was that the guy who got selected had done the coding in notepad during long coding while I had used Netbeans IDE. So that gave him an edge. Tough luck I guess.
