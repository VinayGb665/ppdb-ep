Given a number N which represents the number of rows. The task is to print a half diamond Number-Star pattern as shown in the below examples.
Note: N is always an even number.
Examples:
On carefully observing the above pattern, it can be broken down into two different triangles:
For the first triangle pattern:
The same approach will be followed for the second triangle pattern with a slight change that here the condition will be checked where the inner iteration is equal to 0 or not.
Below is the implementation of above approach:
