If you see the any three consecutive numbers, you can figure out atleast one of them is divisible by 6.
We can use mathematical induction for proving it mathematically.
For a number to be divisible by 6, it should be divisible by 2 and 3.
Since all are even numbers, the number will be divisible by 2.
For checking divisibility of number by 3,
Consider below proof :
