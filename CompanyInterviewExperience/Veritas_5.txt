Veritas visited our college for campus hiring. The selection process included aptitude test, 2 tech interviews and HR interview.
Aptitude test was on hackerrank. It had 20 mcqs based on cs concepts (database:btree, os, html form one que), basic math (no of solutions for p^2 = n+q^2 ),etc and 2 coding questions. There was negative marking for mcqs and solving one coding question was important.
1st tech interview (1Hr):
They asked me which languages I am comfortable with. I chose C and Java.
2nd tech interview (1hr 15 min):
They asked my favourite topics. I said Data structures and DBMS.
HR interview:

Finally they selected 9 people out of 29 and I was one of t hem.
