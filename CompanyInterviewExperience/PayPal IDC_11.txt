Paypal visited our campus in the mid of August.Students of only CS and IT were asked to attend.
First Round-(Online Round):
This round contained two sections.First section had 20 Aptitude questions and the second section had a classical Dynamic programming  problem and our Greedy approach was also passed for the given test cases.
I felt aptitude questions little bit difficult and it consumed much time.Einstein puzzles ,data interpretation questions,C fundamentals and some logical reasoning questions were found in the first section.
Programming question was easy that made me comfortable.
Second Round-(Technical Interview)
Questions from the first round was discussed initially.Followed by a long discussion on my internship experience and my Big Data project was discussed.
Some  graph questions like detecting a cycle in a directed cyclic graph was also discussed.Some design questions were also asked.Interviewers were very cordial and helpful.

Third Round-(Hiring Manager)
This round contained lot of questions only on my resume and about the company.
Again I was asked about my experience in first round.
Some questions about my other activities also asked.
Fourth Round-(HR Interview)
This round contained basic HR questions to check the professional fitness.Some questions about my background and my hobbies.
Overall really loved the entire interview experience, it was really great. 
All the best!!
