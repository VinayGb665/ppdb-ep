Given a string, your task is to reverse only the vowels of string.
Examples:
One simple solution is to store all the vowels while scanning the string and placing the vowels in the reverse order in another iteration of string.
Run on IDE
Output:
Time complexity : O(n) where n = length of string
Auxiliary Space : O(v) where v = number of vowels in string
A better solution is to use two pointers scanning from beginning and end of the array respectively and manipulate vowels pointed by these pointers. 
Run on IDE
Output:
Time complexity : O(n) where n = length of string
Auxiliary Space : O(1)
