Given two integers ‘L’ and ‘R’, write a program to find the total numbers that are having prime number of set bits in their binary representation in the range [L, R].
Examples:

 Explanation:  In this program we find a total number, that’s having prime number of set bit. so we use a  CPP predefined function __builtin_popcount() these functions provide a total set bit in number. as well as be check the total bit’s is prime or not if prime we increase the counter these process repeat till given range.

 Time Complexity : Let’s  n = (r-l)
 so overall time complexity is N*sqrt(N) 
We can optimize above solution using Sieve of Eratosthenes.
