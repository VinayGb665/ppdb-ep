Given a binary tree, find height of it. Height of empty tree is 0 and height of below tree is 3.


Example Tree
Recursively calculate height of left and right subtrees of a node and assign height to the node as max of the heights of two children plus 1.  See below pseudo code and program for details.
Algorithm:
See the below diagram for more clarity about execution of the recursive function maxDepth() for above example tree.
