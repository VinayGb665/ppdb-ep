How do we measure forty-five minutes using two identical wires, each of which takes an hour to burn. We have matchsticks with us. The wires burn non-uniformly. So, for example, the two halves of a wire might burn in 10 minute and 50 minutes respectively 
 
 
 
Answer:
Light up three of the four ends of the two wires. Once one wire is completely burnt, light up the fourth end. At 45 minutes, both wires are burnt completely.
