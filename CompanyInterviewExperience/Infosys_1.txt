Round 2:coding round(3 logic based questions)
Round 3:Technical Interview
Tell me about yourself?
Area of interest, I said programming languages so interview completely based on C, C++, Java questions like difference, diamond problem, upcasting downcasting etc.
One management question- how to handle particular situation.
Last and one of the best question -Do you have any question?
I asked, “what would you suggest me to improve myself”.
I felt so happy and one of the first and best interview experience in my life.
I got selected now.interview is held in Septembe 2018 at hinjewadi phase 2.
Round 4: HR Interview
Simple questions like job preference, relocation, domain work etc.
Thank you!
