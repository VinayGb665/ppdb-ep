Given a sorted array and a value x, the floor of x is the largest element in array smaller than or equal to x. Write efficient functions to find floor of x.
Examples:

Method 1 (Simple)
A simple solution is linearly traverse input sorted array and search for the first element greater than x.  The element just before the found element is floor of x.
