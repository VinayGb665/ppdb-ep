Hello guys, I am sharing the recruitment process experience of Axio-Net.
I got a call from Axio-Net by email. After that, I had appeared for their first round. 
First round was a aptitude round. Their are bunch of simple basic numerical questions, 1 Sudoku problem and few basic technical questions. I had selected in the first round and was waiting for the second round. 
After 7 days from the 1st round, they again called me for the 2nd round. In that 2nd round, the interviewer was the director of axio-net, he is a nice guy. He asked me few basic numerical and few basic programming questions. That’s it. They told me that if I’ll be selected by them, they’ll call me.
If any fresher will appear for axio-net recruitment process, then prepare well your aptitude skills and basics of the technical. If possible try to solve the Sudoku problem.
