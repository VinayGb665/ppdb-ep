The set::value_comp() is an inbuilt function in cpp that returns a copy of the comparison object used by the container. This object determines the order of the elements in the container. It is a function pointer or a function object that takes two arguments of the same type as the container elements, and returns true if the first argument is considered to go before the second in the strict weak ordering it defines, and false otherwise. Two elements of a set are considered equivalent if value_comp returns false reflexively (i.e., no matter the order in which the elements are passed as arguments).
Syntax:
Parameters: This function does not accept any parameter.
Return value: The function returns a copy of the comparison object used by the container.
Below program illustrates the above function.
