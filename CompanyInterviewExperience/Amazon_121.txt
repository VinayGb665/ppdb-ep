I recently had an interview at amazon for SDE2 role. I am here to share my experience :
Telephonic :
1. you are given a string and hashmap.
replace all characters that are present in hashmap with hash value and generate all possible combinations.
2. Given a tree, print all cousins of node that is given as input.
Round 1
Interviewer was really nice guy, he was helpful and gave hints while solving
1. Implement LRU – time 45 min
as 15 min were left, so he asked one more ques and said we wont code for it.
2. given an unsorted array, get the median of array. – this has to be done in O(n)
We had discussion on this i tried all DS to look for solution, he gave me hint that i can sort, so i came up with solution in which i used optimised quick sort and i was also asked to code in last 3 min.
Round 2
1. He asked me to design Parking Lot.
2. He asked me to code zig-zag printing of binary tree.
we also had discussion on challenges of my past experiences.
Round 3
This was bar-raiser, i got to know after the round.
1. He asked me about my experience and background and asked some tricky questions on leadership.
2. Asked me to design the flight system with src, destination and no of hops. (i coded 3.5 pages of solution :))
3. Why you want to join amazon ?
4. How will optimise the performance and check for leaks ?
Round 4
This guy was very smart, he pin points anything that i say and marks it.
discussion about my background.
1. Why did you shutdown your company ?
2. why amazon ?
3. Tell me about your failures ?
4. Tell me about your project with max technical difficulty ?
5. How will optimise any system ?
6. Design a Railway system – it was very lenghty stuff, i coded around 5 pages.

Happy to receive the offer and join here…:)
