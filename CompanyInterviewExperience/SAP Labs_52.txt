LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers is the smallest number which can be divided by both numbers.
For example LCM of 15 and 20 is 60 and LCM of 5 and 7 is 35.

A simple solution is to find all prime factors of both numbers, then find union of all factors present in both numbers. Finally return product of elements in union.
An efficient solution  is based on below formula for LCM of two numbers ‘a’ and ‘b’.
We have discussed function to find GCD of two numbers. Using GCD, we can find LCM.
