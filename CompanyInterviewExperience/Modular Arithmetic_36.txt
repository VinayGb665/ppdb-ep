Given two numbers x and y, find unit digit of xy.
Examples :

Method 1 (Simple)  Compute value of xy and find its last digit. This method causes overflow for slightly larger values of x and y.
Method 2 (Efficient) 
1) Find last digit of x.
2) Compute x^y under modulo 10 and return its value.

Further Optimizations:  We can compute modular power in Log y.
Method 3 (Direct based on cyclic nature of last digit)
This method depends on the cyclicity with the last digit of x that is
So here we directly mod the power y with 4 because this is the last power after this all numberâ€™s repetition  start
after this we simply power with number x last digit then we get the unit digit of produced number.
