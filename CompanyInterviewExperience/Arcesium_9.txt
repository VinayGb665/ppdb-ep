Given an array of integers you have to find three numbers such that sum of two elements equals the third element.
Examples:
Question source : Arcesium Interview Experience | Set 7 (On campus for Internship)

Simple approach: Run three loops and check if there exists a triplet such that sum of two elements equals the third element.
Time complexity : O(n^3)
Efficient approach : The idea is similar to Find a triplet that sum to a given value.
Time complexity : O(n^2)
