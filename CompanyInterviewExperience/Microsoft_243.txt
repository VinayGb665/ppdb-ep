Example:- 
Choose any data structure of the input (array of structures or linked lists or queue).
Design Test cases for the same.

Question 2:
Given a BST, create a Doubly Linked List from the same in place.
Tree node -> left pointer = DLL node -> previous pointer
Tree node -> right pointer = DLL node -> next pointer
