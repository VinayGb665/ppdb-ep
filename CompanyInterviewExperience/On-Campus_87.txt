ROUND 1:
The first round was on hackerrank platform. It consisted of 30MCQ’s and 3 coding questions. The MCQ’s consisted of a mixture of aptitude and technical questions. The three coding questions were:
RGB values were provided for 5 colors in a table format. The input will be an array of strings. Each string has 24 binary digits. We were supposed to convert the string into RGB values and calculate the minumum distance from  given colours using the following formula
d = sqrt((r1-r2)^2+(b1-b2)^2+(g1-g2)^2))
If 110111011010101000111110 is a string then 11011101 is R and 10101010 is G and 00111110 is B. We need to print the color with minumum d. If there are many colours with the same minumum d then print “ambiguous”.
The second question was a variation of the famous n-queens problem. The board with it’s queen positions was already given.  We have to print the queen position which collides with maximum number of other queens. It was very similar to this:

The third question was based on dynamic programming:
