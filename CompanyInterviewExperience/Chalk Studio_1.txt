Method 2
The idea is simple, we run a loop to find the largest multiple of ‘divisor’ that is smaller than or equal to ‘num’. Once we find such a multiple, we subtract the multiple from ‘num’ to find the divisor.
Following is the implementation of above idea.  Thanks to eleventyone for suggesting this solution in a comment.
