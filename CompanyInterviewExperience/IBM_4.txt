IBM visited our campus in the month of September for the recruitment of Associate System Engineers.
Round 1: It was an online test and it consisted analytical questions(number series, series generation etc).This was an adaptive test consisted 16  questions and you can spend a maximum of 2 minutes & 15 seconds on one question or the test will be submitted automatically.
Then their was an English test to check your grammar and basic knowledge of sentence formation around 20 questions. In this test also there was a time limit per question.
More than 1500 students appeared for the online test out of which 77 were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 2: It was an Interview round (and it was conducted by an HR person, so not too much technical) where i was asked some questions related to my favorite subject and some project based questions. Thereafter, he asked about my hobbies and extra- curricular activities and achievements.
Out of 77 students interviewed 31 were finally selected.
