Forward list in STL implements singly linked list. Introduced from C++11, the forward list is useful than other containers for insertion, removal and moving operations (like sort) and allows time constant insertion and removal of elements.It differs from the list by the fact that forward list keeps track of the location of only next element while list keeps track to both next and previous elements.
This function is used to insert a new element into the forward list container, the new element is added to the beginning of the forward list.
