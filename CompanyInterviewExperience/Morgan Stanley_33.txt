Recently Morgan Stanley visited our Campus for recruitment. Hereâ€™s my experience.
Round 1 (Aptitude):
    19 MCQ on CS concepts.
    2 easy coding questions
    Find maximum contiguous sub array sum in a given array.
    Given an array find the sum of elements between the given range.
In both the questions the test cases were very easy and also time limit was also not strict.
Round 2 (F2F):
One on One interview were help the next day. I waited for about 3 hrs for my turn.
The following questions were asked to me:
    Parse floating point numbers from a stream of input.
    How would you implement the Tabs system of chrome where closing one tab will automatically take you to the previously modified one.
    CS concepts like Virtual Memory and Paging etc.
    Data structures to implement LRU and LFU caches.
    Asked me about my language of choice- I said C++.
    Then he discussed Virtual Functions in C++. How to implement them and why they are required.
I was rejected after the interview and only 9 students were shortlisted.
Tips;
    Stay calm and focused.
    Try to understand the question correctly and represent your thought process.
    Approach as you would do in a real life scenario.
I thank GeeksForGeeks for providing such an amazing place to share our experiences and gain load from it.
