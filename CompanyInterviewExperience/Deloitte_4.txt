Round 1: The round 1 consisted of a computer adaptive test which was pretty easy to solve. Logical was a bit difficult as compared to the quant and the verbal section.
Round 2: It’s a Case Study discussion round in which we were given a case to discuss upon. There is no extra weight-age for starting the discussion. Staying with the group is paramount.
Round 3:  This was a personal interview round which was totally revolving around the resume. Questions were asked from the projects and internships mentioned in the resume. Every part of the resume was examined and atleast one question from every pint can be expected in the interview.
