Given a Number n such that 1 <= N <= 10^6, the Task is to Find the LCM of First n Natural Numbers.
Examples:

We have discussed a simple solution in below article.
Smallest number divisible by first n numbers
The above solution works fine for single input.  But if we have multiple inputs, it is a good idea to use  Sieve of Eratosthenes to store all prime factors. As we know if LCM(a, b) = X so any prime factor of a or b will also be the prime factor of ‘X’.
Illustration: 
Below is C++ implementation of above idea.
