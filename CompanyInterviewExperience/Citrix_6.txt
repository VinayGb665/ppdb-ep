Written Tests:-
There was a 1 hr aptitude test & 1 hour coding round. The aptitude test had simple questions on c/cpp, Networking, OS etc. and some general quantitative aptitude questions.
The coding round had 2 questions to be done in an hour.
Q1: A matrix of 1s & 0s are given, you have to find no of groups of adjacent 1s. Adjacency was based on 8-connectedness. (Finding no of components in an undirected graph) (Islanding problem :- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/)

Strengths and weaknesses.?
What profile you’re targeting here in citrix.?
What do you do apart from coding and studies.?
How many apps have you published till date and why you didn’t publish the rest.?
Any shortcomings in our interview process.?(I told them, I didn’t like the HackerEarth platform on which they take tests. )
Tips/Advices:- 
They were mainly looking for guys who had done lots of projects in software. In the whole interview process they only focused on my projects and  fundamentals of java. They didn’t ask me anything that’s not in my resume. So, Don’t write anything in your resume that you’re not confident about. They just want you to have sound  basic concepts.
