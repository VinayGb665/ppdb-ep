Given a number n, we need to find the sum of each digits of the number till the number becomes a single digit. We need to print “yes” if the sum is a prime or “no” if it is not prime.
Examples:

The idea is simple, we can quickly find recursive sum of digits.
Once, recursive sum is calculated, check if it is prime or not by simply checking if it is 2, 3, 5 or 7 (These are only single digit primes).
