In mathematics, Bertrand’s Postulate states that there is a prime number in the range  to  where n is a natural number and n >= 4. It has been proved by Chebyshev and later by Ramanujan. A lenient form of the postulate states that there exists a prime in range n to 2n for any n(n >= 2).

There exists a prime p for  for all n <= 4. The less stricter form states that there exists a prime p. For  for all n <= 2. 
   Examples:
        For n = 4 and 2*n – 2 = 6,
         5 is a prime number in the range (4, 6).
        For n = 5 and 2*n – 2 = 8,
         7 is a prime number in the range (5, 8).
        For n = 6 and 2*n – 2 = 10,
         7 is a prime number in the range (6, 10).
        For n = 7 and 2*n – 2 = 12,
         11 is a prime number in the range (7, 12).
        For n = 8 and 2*n – 2 = 14,
         11 is a prime number in the range (8, 14).
