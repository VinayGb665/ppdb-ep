4) Mark and sweep algorithm and garbage collection in Java
5) Construct tree from Inorder and Preorder
6) Serialization in Java
7) How to ensure that instance is never garbage collected?

8) Questions related to classloader, rt.jar?
9) Difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
10) Why String is immutable in Java?
