I have divided it in 3 parts. I am assuming reader has basic knowledge of Android and java.
Introduction
Retrofit 2 is type-safe REST client build by square for Android and Java which intends to make it simpler to expend RESTful webservices. Retrofit 2 use OkHttp as the systems administration layer and is based over it. Retrofit naturally serializes the JSON reaction utilizing a POJO (PlainOldJavaObject) which must be characterized in cutting edge for the JSON Structure . To serialize JSON we require a converter to change over it into Gson first. Retrofit is much simpler than other libraries we don’t have to parse our json it directly returns objects but there is one disadvantage also it doesn’t provide support to loadimages from server but we can use picasso for the same. Now we should go for some practical implementation which will give better understanding to you.
Implementation
Step-1 :  For using Retrofit in our android project firstly we have to add dependency in gradle file. For adding dependency open app/build.gradle file in your Android project and add the following lines inside it. Add these lines inside dependencies{}
Step-2 :  We should now add InternetPermission inside Manifestfile.Open the manifest.xml file and add the following line.
Step-3 :  For retrieving data from the server using retrofit 2 we require a modelclass. We are going to make model class to retrieve data from the server.For making modelclass we should know how the json looks.
Suppose our json looks something like this : 

"current_page":1,
      "data":
[
         {
            "id":1,
            "source":"http:\/\/mhrd.gov.in\/sites\/upload_files\/mhrd\/files\/upload_document\/NSISGE-Scheme-Copy.pdf",
            "name":"National Scheme of Incentive to Girls for Secondary Education (NSIGSE)",
            "sector":"Education",
            "government":"Central",
            "eligible_beneficiaries":"Individual",
            "requirements":"i. Girls, who pass class VIII examination and enroll for class IX in State\/UT Government, Government-aided or local body schools.\nii. Girls should be below 16 years of age (as on 31st March) on joining class IX\niii. Girls studying in private un-aided schools and enrolled in schools run by Central Government like KVS, NVS and CBS affiliated Schools are excluded.",
            "benefits":"FD of Rs.3000 in the name of selected girls. The girls are entitled to withdraw the sum along with interest thereon on reaching 18 years of age and on passing 10th class examination.",
            "how_to_apply":"Contact Principal\/Headmaster of the School",
            "profession":"",
            "nationality":"",
            "gender":"Female",
            "social_category":[
               "SC",
               "ST",
               "Girls from Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas"
            ],
            "bpl":"",
            "maximum_income":"",
            "maximum_monthly_income":"",
            "min_age":14,
            "max_age":18,
            "age_relaxation":"",
            "qualification":8,
            "employed":"",
            "domicile":"",
            "marital_status":"Unmarried",
            "parents_profession":"",
            "person_with_disabilities":"",
            "current_student":"Yes",
            "min_marks_in_previous_examination":"",
            "religion":"",
            "isDeleted":"false",
            "isLatest":"false",
            "isPopular":"false",
            "isHtml":"false",
            "state_url":"http:\/\/161.202.178.14\/kalyani\/storage\/states\/AORGzbxjrB3zHhAyfs6zTqpt3pQhJsHRwSC4JVBs.png",
            "sector_url":"http:\/\/161.202.178.14\/kalyani\/storage\/sector\/lDASDAsje3BuWQYgaBCqKKWwkfKEuqIvVYp3dp53.png"
         },
....
]"from":1,
      "last_page":75,
      "next_page_url":"http:\/\/localhost:8081\/\/api\/v1\/search?page=2",
      "per_page":10,
      "prev_page_url":null,
      "to":10,
      "total":741

If you see the json you will realize that json contains different fields like source, stateurl, sectorurl, id, name, sector, government, id, name, sector, government, eligibleBeneficiarieand etc for all the fields we have created getter setter and used parcelable(https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Parcelable.html).
Here is the code for model class please read it for better understanding.
Run on IDE
You must have observed that we have used pagination in json (we are retrieving data in a set of 10).For handling this pagination we will create one more java file.
Here is the code for pagination please read it for better understanding.
Run on IDE
Now we have created model class(forhandlingdata) and pagination class(handling pagination in json).Now we have to create adapter and API service provider and display our data.We will cover these things in second and third part of this tutorial.
