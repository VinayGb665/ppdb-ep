Given two numbers represented by linked lists, write a function that returns the multiplication of these two linked lists.
Examples:
Solution:
Traverse both lists and generate the required numbers to be multiplied and then return the multiplied values of the two numbers.
Algorithm to generate the number from linked list representation:
Use the above algorithm with both of linked lists to generate the numbers.
