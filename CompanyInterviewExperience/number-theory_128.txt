How does this formula work?
We can prove the formula using mathematical induction. We can easily see that the formula holds true for n = 1 and n = 2. Let this be true for n = k-1.
The above program causes overflow, even if result is not beyond integer limit. Like previous post, we can avoid overflow upto some extent by doing division first.
