Those who are preparing for interviews, I would like to advise them.
a). Be focused,try to grasp in one go any question.
b). Donâ€™t hurry and give wrong answers.Instead take time(not too much) and give correct answer.
And last of all prepare from geeksforgeeks. It is such a platform that will help you in coding and other topics. Apart from that for coding, do interviewbit, hackerrank..
