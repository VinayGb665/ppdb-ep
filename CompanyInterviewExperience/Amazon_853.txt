Using ffs() function: ffs() function returns the index of first least significant set bit. The indexing starts in ffs() function from 1.
For example:
n = 12 = 1100
In above example, ffs(n) returns the rightmost set bit index which is 3.

Using XOR and & operator : 
Initialize m as 1 as check its XOR with the bits starting from the rightmost bit. Left shift m by one till we find the first set bit, as the first set bit gives a number when we perform a & operation with m.
