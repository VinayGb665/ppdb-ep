This template in C++ is used to convert the value generated by g into a floating point value in the range [0, 1) preserving the uniformity properties of sequences generated with g. To generate enough entropy generate_canonical() will call g() exactly ‘k’ times where,

Syntax:
Template parameters: This template accepts three parameters as mentioned above and described below:
Parameters: The generate_canonical() function accepts single parameter g which is used as uniform random number generator object. It is used to acquire entropy.

Return value: This function returns a floating point value in range [0, 1).
Below programs illustrate the above C++ template
