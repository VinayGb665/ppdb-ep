The acos() is an inbuilt function in C++ STL which returns the inverse cosine of a number (argument) in radians. The value which is returned by the acos() function always lies between – to +
Syntax :
Parameters :This function accepts one mandatory parameter x which specifies the value whose inverse cosine should be computed. It must lie between -1 and +1, else a domain-error is thrown. The parameter can be of double, float or long double datatype. 
Return :The function returns a numeric value between – and +. It is the counterclockwise angle which is measured in radian.
