Recently MAQ came to our campus for internship and placement offers. The whole process for interns were divided into three rounds.
First round was aptitude.Questions came from:
-Time and Work
-Calendars
-Mixtures
and other classic questions like the horse racing puzzle
Second Round was coding.Questions:
-N Queen
-Dutch National Flag
Third round was group discussion. Topic was should courses like nptel be encouraged or not as they tend to lower the attendance of students.
