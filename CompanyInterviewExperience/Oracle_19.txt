Recently Oracle visited our campus IIT Bhubaneswar and here are my experiences…
Round 1: 
It’s an online MCQ round in which their is a timer set for each section..Total there are three sections
Round 2 : Technical Interview
It’s a F2F with two interviewers at once, they asked to introduce myself ,which state i belong, programming languages I know and they were noting my responses in the feedback form.
They started asking questions from my resume about my projects, internships and asked about genetic algorithm(which i did in my intern).
The problem is that they are not encouraging and one interviewer seemed to be very disinterested in the whole process.
Finally he asked me to wait till they get back after lunch (waited for almost 6 hrs).  After that I was rejected without any further round been taken(after waiting for 6hrs),I felt very bad because my whole day is wasted..overall a very bad experience to experience such things from a reputed company.
Round 3:
Others who were selected had gone through technical round and an final hr round.
