TCS is only the company that visits my college. So I started preparing for the written tests, 15 days before the interviews.
Written: It consists of 3 parts:
(Practice from given sites)
If you clear this written round then after 2-3 days you will be called for the F2F Interviews.
Round 1: Technical round :
Round 2: Managerial Interview:
Round 3: HR round:
I was the second last in the HR round so HR called me and my friend together in the room and took the interview.
After the lot of stress and questions I just prayed GOD and reached home. After 1 week we got our results and I was selected. 
I wrote this answer since many people wants to know about my experience. Hope its helps someone. Good luck!
