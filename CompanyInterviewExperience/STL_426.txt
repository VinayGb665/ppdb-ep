Given an array and a number k where k is smaller than size of array, we need to find the k’th smallest element in the given array.
Examples:

We use set in C++ STL.
1) Insert all elements into a set.
2) Traverse the set and print k-th element.
Run on IDE
Output:
Time complexity of above solution is O(n Log n). Note that set in STL uses a self-balancing BST internally and therefore time complexity of search and insert operations is O(log n).
