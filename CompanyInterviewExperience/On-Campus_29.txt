Techracers visited our campus, there were almost 330 students. First round was pen paper based coding round in which 3 problems were asked which were based on arrays and strings.
Almost 48 students cleared first round and we were called at company for furthur interview rounds.

2nd Round: There was again a coding round in which we were asked to write code in any language of our comfort.Main aim was to check logic behind solving the problem.There were two problems one was based on mathematics and 2nd was on array . In array question efficiency of the code was real concern.

3rd round: Those who cleared 2nd round were asked to stay and one more problem was given based on strings (moreover it was to check whether strings are anagrams ignoring special characters such as $, @, # etc..)

Technical Interview: In technical interview first I was asked general questions, then interviewer saw my codes and asked to increase efficiency of codes and also asked time complexity of all those codes. Then he gave me 2D maze problem and asked to code it recursively. I tried but could solve it in iterative way. Then he aksed me about my projects, I explained it. Then I was asked to wait.

HR Interview: HR was cool, first asked me about myself, then asked me general questions about my family and so on . Then she asked why do you want to join techracers, I answered that the technologies on which this companies are working are cutting edge technologies like blockchain etc.. And i will get to learn much more here .Then I was asked to wait for the results.
Finally my name was in the list.Total 12 students were selected.
