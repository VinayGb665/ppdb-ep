Samsung visited our campus.
I.      Written test :
Online test consisting of a coding question, which was to be solved in 3 hours. 
Given an integer ‘K’ and a tree in string format. We had to print the sum of all elements at Kth level from root.
For example:- 
Tree was given in the form: (node value(left subtree)(right subtree))
For tree given above: (0(5(6()())(4()(9()())))(7(1()())(3()())))
Input format: K  Tree
Output format: Sum
For example, for given tree:
Input: 2  (0(5(6()())(4()(9()())))(7(1()())(3()())))
Output: 14
Students, who were able to pass all the test cases, shortlisted for next round.
