Print the elements of an array in the decreasing frequency if 2 numbers have same frequency then print the one which came first.
Examples:
We have discussed different approaches in below posts :
Sort elements by frequency | Set 1
Sort elements by frequency | Set 2
Sorting Array Elements By Frequency | Set 3 (Using STL)
All of the above approaches work in O(n Log n) time where n is total number of elements. In this post, a new approach is discussed that works in O(n + m Log m) time where n is total number of elements and m is total number of distinct elements.
The idea is to use hashing.     
The C++ implementation is given below.
Run on IDE
Output:
Time Complexity : O(n) + O(m Log m)  where n is total number of elements and m is total number of distinct elements
