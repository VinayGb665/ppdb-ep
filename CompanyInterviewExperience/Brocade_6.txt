 Recently I attended Brocade Communications Interview.  I would like to share my experiences.
First Round: Written round 15 Aptitude + 25 Technical MCQs (c++ (mainly output qs), 2 questions on socket, 1 on  IPC, 1 on Database  in 1 hour. The qs were little above average.
After 1 hour they announced results. They shortlisted half of the people.
Second Round: Interview 
1) merge two sorted linked lists in a third linked list
2) how will you search a sequence of  bits over array of bytes
3) Design Qs: You have an incoming stream of bits. You have infinite memory, processing power. Design a system that will check for viruses. You have all the viruses signatures.
4) Same qs, You have limited processing power. How would you do?
5) When do you use Red Black tree, Avl tree
6) swap the nibbles in a byte. 0101 0001 -> 0001 0101
7) some pointer output qs.
->       void *p=0; p+=2; printf(“%d”,*p);
->       int **p=0; printf(“%d”,**p);
8) current project in your company

Third Round :Interview (Manager)
1) find if a tree is a binary search tree or not
2) count the number of set bits in a byte( in the best possible way)
