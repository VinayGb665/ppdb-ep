Round 1:
1> given a number, and an encoding technique like 1-> A, 2-> Câ€¦. 26->Z, How may different valid encryption can be done. Like 123 can be decoded as ABC or LC or AW. so the count is 3
2>  given an array of -1, 0, 1 in an unsorted matter. sort it in order of n time conplexity
3> How to get the top 10 occurring words from a file which is dynamically changing
Round 2:
1> traverse a tree in spiral order.
2> traverse a tree in spiral order using a stack and a queue
3> given a string in form of a linked link. check if it is palindrome or not .
Round 3:
1> Given an array which contains value in range 0 to N^2. sort it in order of N time complexity.
2> Find the largest monotonically increasing subsequence.
3> Given a binary tree, check if it is a binary search tree or not.
