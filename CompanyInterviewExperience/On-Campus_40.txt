I applied through College Campus Placement for the post of Associate Java Developer. The process took 2 weeks.
Round 1: (Aptitude Test)
It was an online aptitude test conducted on Google Forms. It consists of two sections, aptitude and programming, in which there were 20 aptitude questions based on  time and work, train, hcf and lcm, profit and loss, boats and streams etc. and 5 programming questions based on Java (outputs of or errors in programs)
Round 2: (Coding Test)
After first round, for the Java Developer post 8 candidates were shortlisted out of 50-60 candidates. In this round two moderate level array based programming questions is given to be solved in 1 hour.
Question 1:
Given an sorted integer array A, find the subarrays whose size is k with sum of s.
Question 2:
Given an integer array A, sort the array according to the frequency of elements in decreasing order, if frequency of two elements are same then sort in increasing order
In this round they saw my GeeksForGeeks and HackerEarth Profile as I told them about my socially-activeness in such website.
(It is very recommended to have a social profile in these two sites)
In this round 3 candidates were shortlisted
Round 3: (Technical Interview)
Then he asked me to ask anything. I asked about the products of their company
Round 4: (Technical+Managerial Interview)
This was the last round conducted at Verdantis Office (Mumbai). The interview was taken by the VP of Verdantis.
The interviewer was very friendly, calm and polite. First he asked me about myself and about my project which I had mentioned it in my resume. Then, he asked me about technology used in my project and how two users cannot access their files in the system.
Luckily, I was selected for this post.
Thank You! and All the best!
