Question:
Ticket Scalpers:
Given an array of tickets held by n scalpers.
The cost of a ticket at the scalper is equal to the number of tickets at a scalper at that particular moment. i.e if a 1st Scalper  has 4 tickets at present then the cost of a ticket will be $4. After he sells that ticket he has 3 tickets, so the next ticket will cost $3 and so on.
If N number of tickets scalpers are seated outside a hockey stadium what is the maximum amount they can earn for the first ‘k’ tickets sold:
Input: Given n (Number of scalpers), given an array which has number of tickets held by  each ticket scalper, the value of k.
