Round 1 üôÅ 45-50 minutes)

1.	Write an algorithm for converting bst to sorted doubly link list.
Round 3 : (1 hour)

4.	One puzzle of red and blue balls , I told him that I know the solution.
5.	One simple dp question to find the number of ways to reach n if 1 or 2 steps are allowed, I said I have already solved a good version of this question if 1 to m steps are allowed using simple dp. He smiled and said I am not going to ask any questions  you are going to the next round. And admired me about my honesty.
