It was a drive. I was shocked to see 100+ Candidates in Exam Hall.
I think, Around 20 candidates cleared Written Test.(Yeah… I’m In)

1st Round: Written Test ( Duration: 60 Mins)
5 MCQ ( all c++ Code snippets )
1. template without arguments
2. vector erase in for loop
3. deleting a pointer twice
4. sizeof  Vs strlen
5. sizeof of derived class with Virtual Functions in it’s base class.
1 Programming Question.
–> Event Management. Given some event intervals , each Interval {s,e} will contain start & end time. ( InterVal Tree Problem I)
Asked to Implement the following Operations:
==> 1.Add/Delete an event
==> 2.Find Events happening in any given time.
==> 3.Get All overlapping Events
==> 4.Time & Space Complexity of each operation.
Have to write syntactically correct Code for these 4 Operations.

2nd Round:(FF2F)
They started with asking about my Current work/Company…etc
I was asked to write code for Stack Implementation. I Answered it, Using Array.
Then, they asked what do you once if goes out of space. I modified my answer using Vector.
Next was some video player test cases. It’s bit lengthy problem statement.
the crux of the question is you given bunch of intervals. I have to write a code to print all the time missing interval’s.
ex. (4,10), (3,8), (12,20). Interval Range: 0-25, find out the missing intervals in this range?
Output:(0,3)(10,12)(20,25) .
I couldn’t able to provide a solution in my 1st attempt. They gave me some time to think & Answer. In 2nd Attempt i quiet solved it.
My Solution:
sort the given intervals on Starting Time of intervals.
For the above example, they look like (3,8) (4,10) (12,20).
Iterate through this sorted intervals, print missing intervals. 
that’s all. I was asked to leave after 2nd round.
