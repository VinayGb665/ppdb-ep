Round 1: 
First round was a online test based on the platform AMCAT. In this round questions were from basic aptitude, reasoning, English as well as from the basic subjects of computer science like OS, Networks, Algorithms, C/C++ programming. There were 2 coding questions too, different for everyone. I got one question from pattern which was easy and one moderate question of array. In this round all you need is a calm head and you can be through this round. Total 46 were selected for further round.

Round 2:
This round was technical round which was a grilling round of around 1 hr. The interviewer was very calm and cool and made me feel comfortable first. Firstly he checked every single detail of my resume and asked questions from that.
Round 3:
This round was both technical & managerial round. Few technical questions, writing code for a program then few questions from projects and C++ then
Round 4:
This round was all about normal HR questions. Around 9-10 people had HR rounds.
My HR round was over. I was asked to wait again, for the last time though. One should prepare these questions beforehand otherwise you might end up saying something inappropriate there.
Finally 5 were selected. I was one among them.
