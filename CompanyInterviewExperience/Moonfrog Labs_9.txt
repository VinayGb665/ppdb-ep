Moonfrog Labs Interview Experience
Recently I got interviewed at Moonfrog Labs. Here is my interview experience.
Round 1(1 hour):
The interviewer was very friendly and helping. She started with my introduction and discussed a bit about my current project. 
Q1. Check whether a graph can be converted to a tree or not.
First we have to discuss the approach and then code on paper.
Q2. Design a jigsaw puzzle.
Discussion on this went for long and I have to write the class diagram and definition for few functions which I mentioned in my design. 
Round 2(1 hour):
Q1. Reverse a singly linked list (Both iterative and recursive approach).
Q2. Add 2 numbers represented in the form of linked list.
Q3. Print nodes at a given distance K from the given node in a binary tree.
Q4. Given an array of integers, at each index I can take steps upto the value at that index. I have to find the minimum number of hops required to traverse the complete array.
For example: input[] ={2,5,3,6,8,1,3}
From index 0, I can take 1 or 2 steps. From index 1, I can take 1,2,3,4 or 5 steps and so on.
Round 3(30 minutes):
Q1. Two players are playing a game in which each have to pick 1, 2, 3 or 4 coins in each turn. There are n coins in total. Design a strategy to win the game.
Q2. http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/487/A
I was not able to solve this question.
I did not receive the offer but it was a good experience. I would like to thank geeksforgeeks for providing such an awesome platform for interview preparation.
