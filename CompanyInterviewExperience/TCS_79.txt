We can also give command-line arguments in C and C++. Command-line arguments are given after the name of the program in command-line shell of Operating Systems.
To pass command line arguments, we typically define main() with two arguments : first argument is the number of command line arguments and second is list of command-line arguments.

Input:
Output:
Note : Other platform-dependent formats are also allowed by the C and C++ standards; for example, Unix (though not POSIX.1) and Microsoft Visual C++ have a third argument giving the program’s environment, otherwise accessible through getenv in stdlib.h:  Refer C program to print environment variables for details.
Properties of Command Line Arguments:
Note : You pass all the command line arguments separated by a space, but if argument itself has a space then you can pass such arguments by putting them inside double quotes “” or single quotes ”.
