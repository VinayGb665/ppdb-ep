Given an array of jobs where every job has a deadline and associated profit if the job is finished before the deadline.  It is also given that every job takes single unit of time, so the minimum possible deadline for any job is 1. How to maximize total profit if only one job can be scheduled at a time.
Examples:
A Simple Solution is to generate all subsets of given set of jobs and check individual subset for feasibility of jobs in that subset.  Keep track of maximum profit among all feasible subsets.  The time complexity of this solution is exponential. 
This is a standard Greedy Algorithm problem. Following is algorithm.
The Following is C++ implementation of above algorithm.
Run on IDE
Output: 
Time Complexity of the above solution is O(n2). It can be optimized using Disjoint Set Data Structure.  Please refer below post for details.
