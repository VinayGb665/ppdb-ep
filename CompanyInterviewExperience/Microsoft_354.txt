1) Write a program for beautificaion (proper indentation) of a program file in an IDE.
ex:
You are provided with getToken() which returns a token
ex: if(i>10) is a token
int main() is a token
{,} are tokens
so output should be
void beautify(char* inputfile,char* outputfile)
Give some testcases for the above program
2) Write a program to find the diameter of a binary tree and then he wanted to extend it for m-ary tree.

2) Write a program to print the n-nodes from tail of the linked list.
Test cases for above program.
5th Round:
