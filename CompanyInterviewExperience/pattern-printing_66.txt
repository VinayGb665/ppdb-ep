Given a value n, we need to print the following pattern accordingly, using only constant extra space.
Examples:

We can divide this problem into 3 parts:
1) Print upper half with n-1 lines for odd n or n-2 lines for even n.
2) Print middle lines, 1 line for odd n or 3 lines for even n.
3) Print lower half, with n-1 lines for odd n or n-2 lines for even n. 
For such complex patterns it may be easier if we can use 1-based indexing
and separate functions to print characters beginning with x or o.
