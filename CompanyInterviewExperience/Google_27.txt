Given a valid sentence without any spaces between the words and a dictionary of valid English words, find all possible ways to break the sentence in individual dictionary words.
Example

We have discussed a Dynamic Programming solution in below post.
Dynamic Programming | Set 32 (Word Break Problem)
The Dynamic Programming solution only finds whether it is possible to break a word or not. Here we need to print all possible word breaks.
We start scanning the sentence from left. As we find a valid word, we need to check whether  rest of the sentence can make valid words or not. Because in some situations the first found word from left side can leave a remaining portion which is not further separable. So in that case we should come back and leave the current found word and keep on searching for the next word. And this process is recursive because to find out whether the right portion is separable or not, we need the same logic. So we will use recursion and backtracking to solve this problem. To keep track of the found words we will use a stack. Whenever the right portion of the string does not make valid words, we pop the top string from stack and continue finding.
