The C++ function std :: is_sorted checks if the elements in range [first, last] are sorted in ascending order. Elements are compared using < operator.
There are two variants of std::is_sorted:
Example :
Given a container of size n, and a range between [0 … n], write a program to check if it is sorted in ascending order or not. Equal values are allowed in array and two consecutive equal values are considered sorted.
