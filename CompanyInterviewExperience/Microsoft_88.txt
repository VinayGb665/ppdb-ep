First Round (1.5 hour)
1. Discussion on previous projects.
2. Given a sorted integer array, print all distinct elements in array. The given array may contain duplicates and the output should print every element only once.
3. Given a sorted integer array, print all elements that appear only once in array. The given array may contain duplicates and the output should print every element only once.
Solution for both problems required space complexity O(1) & time complexity O(n).
4. Design a system which helps to calculate average Skype call duration per day. In which events are tracked from mobile app. Need to take care of all edge cases like events can be logged to server in any sequence & there can be some events missing on server side also.
Second Round (1 hour)
