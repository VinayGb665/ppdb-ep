In the end I was asked a puzzle, which I was unable to answer.The puzzle was, there is a square shaped building surrounded by a boundary with 1m gap in between, filled with water.We have two planks of length 1m how  can we cross the surrounding water to enter the building.
Answer is, we have to place the plank at the corner in T  shape.
