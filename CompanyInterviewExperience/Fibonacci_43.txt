We are given a Fibonacci number. First few Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, …..
We have to find index of given Fibonacci number, i.e. like fibonacci number 8 is at index 6. 
Examples :

Method 1 (Simple)
Simple approach is to find Fibonacci numbers up to given Fibonacci number and count number of iteration performed.

Method 2 (Formula based)
But here, we needed to generate all the fibonacci number up to provided fibonacci number. But, there is quick solution for this problem. Let’s see how !
Note that computing log of a number is O(1) operation in most of the platforms [Source : Stackoverflow]
Fibonacci number is described as,
Fn = 1 / sqrt(5) (pow(a,n) – pow(b,n)) where
a = 1 / 2 ( 1 + sqrt(5) )  and b = 1 / 2 ( 1 – sqrt(5) )
On neglecting pow(b, n) which is very small for large value of n, we get
 n = round { 2.078087 * log(Fn) + 1.672276 }
where round means round to nearest integer.
Below is the implementation of above idea.
