TopTalent: How do you feel on achieving this rare feat?
I don’t consider it as a ‘rare’ feat, many people have got such good offers in both present and past.
TopTalent: What other offers did you get apart from Facebook?
Facebook was one among my top preferences, I got the offer from Facebook and hence I was out of the placement process. So, one does not get more than one offer.
TopTalent: Can you brief us the interview process?
Facebook had one coding test, after which there were three rounds of interview. All the interviews tested your technical knowledge.
TopTalent: Can you give us a brief account of what you felt was the toughest interview?
TopTalent: What was your preparation strategy?
I practised coding, answering algorithmic design questions. I had a rough overview of all my courses, hence I didn’t spend much time revising them.
TopTalent: What kind of skills do you think helped you getting this job?
A student should know how to code, both on paper and on the system, that is it.
TopTalent: What resources did you consult? Where did you practice problems from?
I used Hackerrank and Codechef for practicing problems.
TopTalent: Were grades a factor in you getting selected?
Good grades is definitely a plus point, but it is neither necessary nor sufficient.
TopTalent: What’s your advice to students who are aiming for similar placement offers as yours?
Relax and prepare hard. You will get what you wish for.
