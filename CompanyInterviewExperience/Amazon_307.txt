Given a number n, find number of ways we can add 3 non-negative integers so that their sum is n.
Examples : 
Method 1 [ Brute Force : O(n3) ]
A simple solutions is to consider all triplets using three loops. For every triplet, check if its sum is equal to n. If sum is n, increment count of solutions. 
Below is the implementation.

Method 2 [ Direct Formula : O(1) ]
If we take a closer look at the pattern, we can find that the count of solutions is ((n+1) * (n+2)) / 2. The problem is equivalent to distributing n + 1 identical balls (for 0 to n) in three boxes and the solution is n+2C2.   In general, if there are m variables (or boxes) and n possible values, the formula becomes n+m-1Cm-1.
