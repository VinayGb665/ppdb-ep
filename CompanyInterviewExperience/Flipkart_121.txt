Given a binary tree, write a function to get the maximum width of the given tree. Width of a tree is maximum of widths of all levels.  
Let us consider the below example tree.
For the above tree,
width of level 1 is 1,
width of level 2 is 2,
width of level 3 is 3
width of level 4 is 2.  
So the maximum width of the tree is 3.

Method 1 (Using Level Order Traversal)
This method mainly involves two functions. One is to count nodes at a given level (getWidth), and other is to get the maximum width of the tree(getMaxWidth). getMaxWidth() makes use of getWidth() to get the width of all levels starting from root.

We can use Queue based level order traversal to optimize the time complexity of this method. The Queue based level order traversal will take O(n) time in worst case. Thanks to Nitish, DivyaC and tech.login.id2  for suggesting this optimization.  See their comments for implementation using queue based traversal.

Method 2 (Using Level Order Traversal with Queue)
In this method we store all the child nodes at the current level in the queue and then count the total number of nodes after the level order traversal for a particular level is completed. Since the queue now contains all the nodes of the next level, we can easily find out the total number of nodes in the next level by finding the size of queue. We then follow the same procedure for the successive levels. We store and update the maximum number of nodes found at each level.

Method 3 (Using Preorder Traversal)
In this method we create a temporary array count[] of size equal to the height of tree. We initialize all values in count as 0.  We traverse the tree using preorder traversal and fill the entries in count so that the count array contains count of nodes at each level in Binary Tree.
