Recently I attended interview at Amazon for SDE 1 profile.
Round 1 (Written):
3 questions were given and I was asked to write the executable code in any language.
Round 2 (F2F):

Round 3 (F2F):
Round 4 (Design Round):
Round 5(Hiring Manager Round):
    Consecutive sequence of maximum length: [66, 67, 68] of length 3.
I had the hunch but was not able to code it at first, so he asked me to do it later then after some discussion, i was given 15 min to complete it and finally in those 15 min it clicked and I managed to do it.
Some advice:
Thank you Geeksforgeeks !!!
