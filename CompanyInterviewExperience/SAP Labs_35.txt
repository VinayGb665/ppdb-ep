2 Coding Qs.
	And if a number is not supported by any other number , then it is said to be bleak number.
	Now given test cases of numbers ,you have to print whether a number is supported or bleak.

Further rounds are Personal Interviews :
Don’t remember the Qs round wise. So, writing questions asked in all rounds topic wise.
2 technical rounds were of 1.5hr and 1 hr.
Every round started with —
tell me about yourself, discussion on projects ..
	After writing query , saw the join which i wrote and asked about inner,natural,outer joins.
	— started telling him 4 concepts – abstraction ,encapsulation ..etc

	then a quick discussion on merge vs quick sort – complexities. nd counting sort.

He then told me to thing as programmer who solves all corner cases … and gave me a case where u don’t know how many and which bulbs work or not..
Managerial round :
HR Round:
Asked where do you see yourselves in 5 yrs.
and then it was more of a casual talk about technologies, college life.
Definitely not a typical HR Round.
