Given positive integers k, a and b we need to print last k digits of a^b ie.. pow(a, b).
Examples:

First Calculate a^b, then take last k digits by taking modulo with 10^k. Above solution fails when a^b is too large, as we can hold at most 2^64 -1 in C/C++.
The efficient way is to keep only k digits after every multiplication. This idea is very simiar to discussed in Modular Exponentiation where we discussed a general way to find (a^b)%c, here in this case c is 10^k.
Here is implementation.
