Deque or Double ended queues are sequence containers with the feature of expansion and contraction on both the ends. They are similar to vectors, but are more efficient in case of insertion and deletion of elements at the end, and also the beginning. Unlike vectors, contiguous storage allocation may not be guaranteed.
push_back() function is used to push elements into a deque from the back. The new value is inserted into the deque at the end, before the current last element and the container size is increased by 1.

Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. Strong exception guarantee â€“ if an exception is thrown, there are no changes in the container.
2. If the value passed as argument is not supported by the deque, it shows undefined behaviour.

Application 
Given an empty deque, add integers to it using push_back() function and then calculate sum of all its elements.
Algorithm
1. Add elements to the deque using push_back() function.
2. Check if the size of the deque is 0, if not, add the front element to the sum variable initialised as 0, and pop the front element.
3. Repeat this step until the size of the deque becomes 0.
4. Print the final value of the variable.
