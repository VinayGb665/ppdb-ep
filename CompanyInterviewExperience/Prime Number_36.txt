A Fortunate number is the smallest integer m > 1 such that, for a given positive integer n, pn + m is a prime number. Here pn is the product of the first n prime numbers, i.e prime factorials (or primorials) of order n.
For example :
Now, the smallest difference m between the prime factorial pn and the first prime number greater than pn for which (m > 1), is a prime number.
Examples :
Approach  : To find the nth Fortunate number, calculate the product of the first n prime numbers (primorial). Let this product be p. Then we find prime number greater than p and return the difference between the found prime number and p.
