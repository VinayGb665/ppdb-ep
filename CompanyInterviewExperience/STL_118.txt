The logb() is a builtin function in C++ STL which returns the logarithm of |x|, using FLT_RADIX as base for the logarithm. In general, the value of FLT_RADIX is 2, so logb() is equivalent to log2()(for positive values only).
Syntax:
Parameter: The function accepts a single mandatory parameter val which specifies the val whose logb() is to be calculated. The data-type can be of double, float, long double or int. 
 Return Type: The function returns the logarithm of |x|.
