2. Given two strings s1 and s2, where s2 is a palindrome, how many substrings(s2) are there if we are allowed to arrange s1 in any order.
3. Check if a string is valid or not. A string is valid if on removing two different characters at a time, you are left string of same character. If the string is empty it is not valid. If the string is valid print the remaining character.
Around 20 of 500 students were selected for interviews.
Technical Interview Round 2:
This was my first technical interview. The Duration of the interview was about 1 hour.
1. Given a vector of strings. He gave another string and asked to print all the anagrams in the order in which they appeared in the vector.
