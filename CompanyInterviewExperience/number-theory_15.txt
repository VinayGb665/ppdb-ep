Given a number ‘n’, the task is to generate the first ‘n’ Stormer numbers.
A Stormer Number is a positive integer ‘i’ such that the greatest prime factor of the term  is greater than or equal to .
For example, 5 is a Stormer number because the greatest prime factor of 26(i.e 5*5 + 1) is 13 which is greater than or equal to 10(i.e 2*5)   

Input : 5
Output : 1 2 4 5 6
Here 3 is not a Stormer number because the greatest prime
factor of 10(i.e 3*3 + 1) is 5, which is not greater than
or equal to 6(i.e 2*3)
Input : 10
Output : 1 2 4 5 6 9 10 11 12 14
