Flipkart has done a drive in Delhi.
Round 1: Machine Coding
You are given some equations which may contain > or = on different-different operand. For example there are valid input and invalid (a=5, b<a=50)
Highlighted one are invalid because they come they ask for overwrite the data (a>b>c = 5; C has e and f so we can overwrite.
Input: You are given those string in string array
Output:
Construct JSON
Print it
If you print in same as above (nice manner) +point
I solved this problem using Trie
One can see my implementation at here: https://github.com/nitsgupta/practice/tree/master/JAVA/JsonBuilder
Round 2: Face To Face Algo DS
1. Do a level order traversal for a tree where order of printing is reversed on each level.
First i gave O(n2) solution they asked for less complexity solution. I then gave BFS solution by keeping a FIFO queue.
2. You are given a file of parent child relations. Data is huge consist of millions of lines.
Provide a data structure to keep data in the memory.
Provide a solution to keep data in permanent storage.
3. You are given a 2*2 matrix which contains cost of visiting each cell. You have to find lowest cost path from 0,0 to m,n where cost is minimum.
You can move only in down and right direction.
I gave a DP solution with complexity O(mn)
