Given an array of words, print all anagrams together. For example, if the given array is {“cat”, “dog”, “tac”, “god”, “act”}, then output may be “cat tac act dog god”.
Other approaches are discussed here in these posts

Here is HashMap solution using C++ Standard Template Library.
Approach :
1) Store the vector elements in HashMap with key as the sorted string
2) if key is same, then add string to value of HashMap(string vector)
3) Traverse the HashMap and print the anagram strings
Run on IDE
Note : Compile above program with -std=c++11 flag in g++
Output:
