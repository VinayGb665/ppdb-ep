Initial Round:
Aptitude Paper: 45 questions to solve in 50mins. Platform was Hackerrank. No negative marking. I solved around 35 approx. correctly.
Online Coding: 3 questions to solve in 90mins. Platform was Hackerrank. Two of them I remember.
First Interview (1hr):
Presented himself and what he do. Took resume and asked “Tell me about yourself”. 
Do you have any questions?
Second Interview ( 1hr + ):
Saw resume and asked “Tell me about yourself”. Questions on Internship, same above. Jumped to coding questions then. 
At last he was very satisfied with my approaches and answers.
Third Interview ( 1hr+):
First “Tell me about yourself” and then long discussion about my Internship. Same above questions of internship but also many questions on Ruby on Rails and about the product which I worked on and my experience, what challenges I faced, what I learned etc.
Then coding questions (all coded on paper): 
I had not asked any questions in the PPT so he asked why I not asked any questions and I was present or not.
Next he opened my answers of the online test and asked why my all test cases not passed in 1st question(10/13 had passed) and why I didn’t attempted 3rd question.
Fourth Interview (20-25mins): HR Round 
*Can be the case that I missed many questions but these are the only one I remember.
