Phone dialer is an activity available with Android operating system to call a number. Usually such activity may or may not have an EditText, for taking number as input, and a Call button. When the user press the Call button, it invokes the dialer app activity. Use of ‘tel:’ prefix is recommended, else java.lang.IllegalStateException will be thrown. Action_Dial doesn’t require any permission.
