Ashok Leyland visited our campus for the profile GET (Graduate Engineer Trainee). Only CS and IT students were eligible to apply and the cut-off was 7.0 CGPA.
Round 1 (Online test): It was conducted on MonsterIndia platform and it had 97 questions – 50 questions technical and 47 questions containing verbal, data interpretation, logical reasoning and quantitative aptitude. The technical questions were mainly from Java and C. A thorough understanding of the basics is essential. The second section was so easy except the quantitative aptitude.

Refer R.S Aggarwal’s book for second section.
