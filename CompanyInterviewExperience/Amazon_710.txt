I recently appeared for amazon which came to our campus. Here is my experience. 
Shortlisting Round.
There were 20 MCQ and 2 programming questions. Each correct answer carried 1 mark and -0.25 for a wrong answer. Programming questions were:
a.  Given a number with the number of digits in the range of 10-50, find the next higher permutation of the number. If such a number doesnâ€™t exist, return -1.
b. Given an array of strings, you need to find the longest running sequence of a character among all possible permutations of the strings in the array.
INPUT:
ab
ba
aac
OUTPUT:
a,3
Then there were 4 rounds of interview.
T1
a. Given link list segregate odd elements first and even elements afterwards.
b. Given a BST of memory sizes. Find best fit for a memory block of size M.
T2.
a. Given 2 sorted arrays of size m and n+m(with n elements) , merge
them into the latter..
b. Given a character array find the first element that repeats itself.
T3.
a. Given a binary tree connect all nodes in a level through link list.
b. Some question related to share market which boiled down to find maximum difference between two elements such that second element appears after the first one.
c. What is thrashing ?
d. Real world application of heaps?
e. Minimum spanning tree and topological sort .
T4.
Around half an hour HR then
Given a function node* inplacemergesort(node* n1, node* n2) which takes 2 linked lists as input and performs in-place merge sort and returns the final list.  How will you test it and make sure it does what it claims.
I was hired ðŸ™‚ .
The interviewers were very friendly, patient and looked for optimal solution to each question .
I am very thankful to geeksforgeeks for such a great site and the way its maintained.It really helped me a lot for my preparation. Keep up the good work guys ðŸ™‚
