Since I had done a couple of Microsoft Certifications on various Operating systems these questions are based on them
1) Design a client server application in which the Active directory has more than 1 lakh users and you need to find all the users starting from A from the client
Answer : You canâ€™t do it. You can only do it on the server. Microsoft server OS does not provide these many rights
