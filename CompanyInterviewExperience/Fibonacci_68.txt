We have discussed different methods to find nth Fibonacci Number.  
Following is another mathematically correct way to find the same.
nth Fibonacci Number :

Here φ is golden ratio with value as 
The above formula seems to be good for finding nth Fibonacci Number in O(Logn) time as integer power of a number can be calculated in O(Logn) time. But this solution doesn’t work practically because φ  is stored as a floating point number and when we calculate powers of  φ, important bits may be lost in the process and we may get incorrect answer.
