Technical Interview 2:
This interview was mostly based on my B.Tech Project on Artificial Intelligence. He also asked many fundamental questions related to AI and Machine Learning. For e.g. what is SVM (Support Vector Machines), ANN(Artificial Neural Networks), GP(Genetic Programming) and differences between them and how it is better than linear regression? He also asked few java OOPS questions.
In all, my interview experience was quite nice. Both interviewers were very helpful and cooperative. Practice writing code on piece of paper. That will help a lot.
