Round 1: The first round was an elimination round, i.e.the online test.The test comprised for 3 sections-the general aptitude and English(easy to moderate difficulty), then came the technical section which mostly focused on OS and CN mcqs(can be solved well if one has really good knowledge of both subjects), and the final section was of programming(2 ques, around 30 min-but the questions weren’t difficult).
Round 2: The next round comprised of 2 technical interviews.Questions were asked from OS, CN, troubleshooting  of network etc(in-depth concepts). Also a few programming questions were asked to some candidates.These 2 rounds and the managerial round were more of elimination rounds.
Round 3: The final round comprised of 2 more interviews-managerial and HR.The managerial interview questions were related to project work, various difficulties faced and various scenario/situation-type questions.The HR interview was also about life experiences and scenarios.The trick is to be completely honest and have a solid justification for all the answers.
The interviewers were quite co-operative and understanding.It was really a great experience.
