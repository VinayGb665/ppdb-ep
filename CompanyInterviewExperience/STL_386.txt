1. Set
(i) Stores the values in sorted order.
(ii) Stores only unique values.
(iii) Elements can only be inserted or deleted but cannot be modified.
(iv) We can erase more than 1 element by giving start iterator and end iterator position.
(v) Traversal using iterators.
(vi) Sets are implemented as Binary Search Tree.

2. Multiset
(i) Stores elements in sorted order.
(ii) It allows storage of multiple elements.
(iii) We can erase more than 1 element by giving start iterator and end iterator.
Note:- All other properties similar to set.
Run on IDE
3. Unordered_set
(i) Elements can be stored in any order. ( no sorted order )
(ii) Stores only unique values.
(iii) Hash-table used to store elements.
(iv) We can erase only the element for which iterator position is given.
Note:- All other properties similar to set.

4. Unordered_multiset
(i) Elements can be stored in any order.
(ii) Duplicate elements can be stored.
(iii) Hash-table used to store elements.
(iv) We can erase only the element for which iterator position is given.
Note:- All other properties similar to set.

Conclusion : 
In simple words, set is a container that stores sorted and unique elements. If unordered is added means elements are not sorted. If multiset is added means duplicate elements storage is allowed.
