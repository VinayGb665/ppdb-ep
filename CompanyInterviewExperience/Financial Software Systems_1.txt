Recently Financial Software Systems visited our campus for recruitments. There were 4 rounds basically:
First round
It was an online aptitude test….there were 60 questions which had to be completed in 60 mins. Most of the questions were very easy .
Around 600 students had sat out of which 204 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Second Round
2nd round was a Group Discussion . The topics were general topics like FDI, Social media, should private colleges be taken over by Govt of India etc. GD was not an elimination round for most.
After GD 190 students made it to technical interview round.
Third Round
For me the questions were on Java, Database, C++ (basics). Some of the questions were:
If you are able to clear the 3rd round you are almost done….The next round was more of a formality round which comprised of me asking questions to the interviewer.
HR Round
Finally, HR round took place which comprised of typical HR questions. Finally 25 were selected from my college.
 Some tips:
1. The company had a service agreement of 3 years for freshers.
2. Be yourself in the interview
3. Have confidence and know the basics
