The ilogb(x) function in C++ STL returns the integral part of the logarithm of |x|, by using the FLT_RADIX as base for the logarithm. In general, the value of FLT_RADIX is 2, so ilogb() is equivalent to ilog2()(for positive values only).
Syntax:
Parameter: The function accepts a single mandatory parmaeter x whose ilogb() is to be calculated. The data-type can be of double, float, long double or int. 
Return Value: The function returns an integral part of the logarithm of |x|, using FLT_RADIX as base for the logarithm. The function returns three exception values:
