In the previous post, we introduced Queue and discussed array implementation.  In this post, linked list implementation is discussed.  The following two main operations must be implemented efficiently.
In a Queue data structure, we maintain two pointers, front and rear. The front points the first item of queue and rear points to last item.
enQueue() This operation adds a new node after rear and moves rear to the next node.
deQueue() This operation removes the front node and moves front to the next node.

Time Complexity: Time complexity of both operations enqueue() and dequeue() is O(1) as we only change few pointers in both operations. There is no loop in any of the operations.
