Stacks are a type of container adaptors with LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working, where a new element is added at one end and (top) an element is removed from that end only.
empty() function is used to check if the stack container is empty or not.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. Shows error if parameter is passed
2. Shows no exception throw guarantee.
Run on IDE
Output:
Application :
Given a stack of integers, find the sum of the all the integers.
Algorithm
1. Check if the stack is empty, if not add the top element to a variable initialised as 0, and pop the top element.
2. Repeat this step until the stack is empty.
3. Print the final value of the variable.

Output:
size() function is used to return the size of the stack container or the number of elements in the stack container.

Algorithm
1. Check if the size of the stack is zero, if not add the top element to a variable initialised as 0, and pop the top element.
2. Repeat this step until the stack size becomes 0.
3. Print the final value of the variable.
