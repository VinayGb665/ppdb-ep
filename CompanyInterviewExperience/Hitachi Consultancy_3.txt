Round 2: Case study based GD(major elimination)
They can give any case study topic. You will be given 10 minutes to read the cases and prepare your points then you will be called for the GD. In my case the GD topic was aeroplane crash survival in desert. Describing the cases as far as I remember.
It’s almost 10 am in the morning. Your aero-plane has crashed before reaching the destination. The pilot could not inform the higher authority about any malfunction in the plane, so nobody right now is aware of this accident. The last talk your pilot had was when the plane was 115 km way from the destination situated in the north-west direction. After the crash both pilot and co-pilot are dead and the plane is burning in frames. Luckily you and all your co-passengers are alive and totally safe till now. You all are in summer dresses wearing socks and sports shoes. Now you have 15 things and you have to rank them accordingly to make great use of them and help your co-passengers and yourself to reach the destination safely. The item list is given below:
the last one i don’t remember now.
