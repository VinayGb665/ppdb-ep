Given an array of integers, write a function that returns true if there is a triplet (a, b, c) that satisfies a2 + b2 = c2.
Example:
Method 1 (Naive)
A simple solution is to run three loops, three loops pick three array elements and check if current three elements form a Pythagorean Triplet.

Time Complexity of the above solution is O(n3).

Method 2 (Use Sorting)
We can solve this in O(n2) time by sorting the array first.  
1) Do square of every element in input array. This step takes O(n) time.
2) Sort the squared array in increasing order. This step takes O(nLogn) time.
3) To find a triplet (a, b, c) such that a2 = b2 + c2, do following. 
Below is the implementation of above algorithm :

Output:
Time complexity of this method is O(n2).
