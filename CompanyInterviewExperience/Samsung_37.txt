Online Round:
It was conducted on cocubes. It had 2 rounds written assessment.
Round 1:
60 questions which were to be solved in 60 minutes. There were 20 questions each on English, Logical and Quantitative Aptitude.
There was no negative marking so attempt as many questions as early as possible and attempt all the left-out in last two-three minutes.
Round 2:
3 coding questions to be solved in 70 minutes.
Questions were:
1. median-of-two-sorted-arrays
2. convert-a-given-tree-to-sum-tree
3. find-closest-leaf-binary-tree
49 students were selected for Group Discussion Round. 
Group Discussion Round:
Single question was asked to each group and four groups were made. First two and last two groups got same question.
Group 1-2 question: Was a design type question based on some abstract ideas. Question was something like that we are given a moving ship with 3 radars placed on it. All three radars have some errors. So we have to propose a technique to find approximate correct location of the ship.  
Group 3-4 question: Similar to this. Our question was like we have a matrix with non-negative distinct integers in each cell. Find maximum length path from any node satisfying the condition that you can move in four basic directions (neighbouring cells) if and only if minimum of the neighbouring elements is less than the current element and you will move to the cell with minimum value if there are multiple cells with value less than current node.
26 students were selected for the internship.
