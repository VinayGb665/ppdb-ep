This function is used to insert a new element into the list container, the new element is added to the beginning of the list.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. It has a strong exception guarantee, therefore, no changes are made if an exception is thrown.
2. Parameter should be of same type as that of the container, otherwise an error is thrown.
Run on IDE
Output:
Time Complexity : O(1)
