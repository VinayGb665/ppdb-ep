I gave my round 1 amazon. There were two coding questions.
1) Given an integer n in the input, find its next sparse binary numberA sparse binary number is a number whose binary representation does not contain any consecutive 1s.
For eg.
72 is a sparse binary number, because its binary representation (01001000) does not contain any consecutive 1s.
17 is a sparse binary number, because its binary representation (00010001) does not contain any consecutive 1s.
Similarly,
12 is a non sparse binary number, because its binary representation (00001100) contains consecutive 1s.
43 is a non sparse binary number, because its binary representation (00101011) contains consecutive 1s.
Now, given an integer n in the input, find its next sparse binary number. n itself can be sparse or non sparse.
where n >= 0 and n < 2^31

Input 12

Output
16

Explanation
12 is 00001100 and next sparse no. to it is 16 (00010000).



2) You are given heights of n candles. 
First day you lit one candle s
Scond day you need to lit two candles 
Third day you need to lit three candles 
.......... 
........ 
till possible. 
After lighting candles the height of candles deduced by 1 each day.You can also extinguish any candle you want but only at the end of day. 
So you need to tell the maximum number number of days , you can carry on lighting the candles. 
Example : there are three candles of heights {2 , 2 ,2 } 
Answer : 3 
1.You light first candle on day one. heights -> {1,2,2}
2.You light second and third and extinguish first one . heights ->{1, 1,1}
3.You light all the candles. heights -{0,0,0}
Hope it helps aspirants.
Online mcq, there were around 20 and 13-14 were from geeksquiz.com
