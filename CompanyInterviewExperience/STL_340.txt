Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.
empty() function is used to check if the vector container is empty or not.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. It has a no exception throw guarantee.
2. Shows error when a parameter is passed.
Run on IDE
Output:
Application :
Given a list of integers, find the sum of the all the integers.
Algorithm
1. Check if the vector is empty, if not add the back element to a variable initialised as 0, and pop the back element.
2. Repeat this step until the vector is empty.
3. Print the final value of the variable.
Run on IDE
Output:
size() function is used to return the size of the vector container or the number of elements in the vector container.

Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. It has a no exception throw guarantee.
2. Shows error when a parameter is passed.

Why is empty() preferred over size()
empty() function is often said to be preferred over the size() function due to some of these points-
Application :
Given a list of integers, find the sum of the all the integers.
Algorithm
1. Check if the size of the vector is 0, if not add the back element to a variable initialised as 0, and pop the back element.
2. Repeat this step until the size of the vector becomes 0.
3. Print the final value of the variable.
