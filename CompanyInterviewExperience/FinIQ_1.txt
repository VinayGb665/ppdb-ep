Recently FinIQ visited our campus and this is my experience.
Round 1:  It was aptitude test of 50 questions.
                25 questions were based on quant, verbal ability and 25 questions were
                based on general knowledge.
                After the test, groups of four people were formed and asked to do a                         particular group activity.
Round 2: Then people who scored less than 20 marks in aptitude test were                           eliminated.They were very few in number.Then began the Interview                         round.
                First interview round took around 10 minutes, in which i was asked 1                       puzzle, 1 mathematical question and 1 basic database question.
                Then, some of the people were eliminated and found there way in for                      third round.
Round 3:  It was more sort of HR round. Playing basketball at state level and                          running youtube channel were the factors that impressed them the                          most.
                 Co-curricular activities earned a plus point for met. Then after,13 people                   qualified for the last round.
Round 4:  We were told to write an essay and design business plan for slum                            rehabilitation. To get more idea about business plan, you can google.
                 Finally, 10 people were selected at the end of day and i was one of                          them.
                 So,i can conclude that following factors would bring the ball in your                          court:-
                 i) Good academic score.
                 ii) Participation in Sports and cultural activities.
          Good luck, All the best.
