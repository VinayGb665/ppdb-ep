Given a binary tree and value k. delete all the leaf nodes with value equal to k. If a node becomes leaf after deletion, then it should be deleted if it has value k.
Examples:

1. Use PostOrder traversal.
2. When we encounter leaf nodes, then we check whether it is leaf node or not.
3. If it is leaf node and value equal to k, then delete it.
4. Else, Recurse for other nodes.
