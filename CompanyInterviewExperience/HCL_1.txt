Had couple of experiences for core Java and multi-threading hiring process at bangalore location.
Round 1:
Usually written round to solve problems. For core Java there were objective questions (abstract class, object overriding, deadlock etc) with 3-4 programming questions requiring hashmap and collections, like checking for anagram.
In another experience I received 5 programming questions. I solved each of them using collections and map (writing comments) but still got rejected, so not sure what they were looking for. (Learn priority queue, tree, hashsets, hashmap, iterating over them). You will be writing on paper so need to remember those simple methods, on maps and sets and iterators, I guess.
Round 2:
F2F discussion.
