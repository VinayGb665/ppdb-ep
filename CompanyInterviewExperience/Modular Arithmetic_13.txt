Given value of N and K. The task is to find the sum of series till N-th term whose i-th term is given by  Ti = i k + ( i – 1 )k. Since the sum of the series can be very large, compute its sum modulo 1000000007.
Example:
Naive Approach  A simple solution is to generate all terms up to n and add them. The time complexity will be O(N). Since N is very large, the approach will result in TLE. 
 Better solution 
Let’s have a look at the series pattern.

Consider N = 4, K = 3
Then the series will be :
13 – (1 – 1)3 + 23 – (2 – 1)3 + 13 – (3 – 1)3 + 43 – (4 – 1)3
i.e   13 – 03 + 23 –  13 + 33 – 23 +  43 – 33
Rewriting the same powers together, we get.
03 + 13 – 13  +  23 –  23 +  33 –  33 +  43 
i.e  03 + 13 –  13 + 23 – 23 + 33 – 33 + 43 
So the final result will be 43  ( i.e  nk )
Hence the final formula stands at NK

Below is the naive way to calculate NK.
