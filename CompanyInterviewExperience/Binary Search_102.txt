Given a number n. The task is to find the smallest number whose factorial contains at least n trailing zeroes.
Examples :

In the article for Count trailing zeroes in factorial of a number, we have discussed number of zeroes is equal to number of 5’s in prime factors of x!. We have discussed below formula to count number of 5’s.
Let us take few examples to observe pattern 
We can notice that, the minimum value whose factorial contain n trailing zeroes is 5*n.
So, to find minimum value whose factorial contains n trailing zeroes, use binary search on range from 0 to 5*n. And, find the smallest number whose factorial contains n trailing zeroes.
