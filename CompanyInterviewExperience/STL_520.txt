Given a pattern and a text, find all occurrences of pattern and its anagrams in text.
Examples:

We have discussed a (n) solution  her. But in this post it is done using is_permutation(). Although the complexity is higher than previously discussed method, but the purpose is to explain application of is_permutation().
Let size of pattern to be searched be pat_len. The idea is to traverse given text and for every window of size pat_len, check if it is a permutation of given pattern or not.
