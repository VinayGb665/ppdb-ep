Amdocs came for campus recruitment in our college.It conducted an online test on a platform (i donâ€™t remember the name though).The test consisted of 4 different sections namely technical, verbal,apti&logical, and one programming question.There were total 61 questions (1 programming question) to be done in 110 minutes.Time was a big constraint as aptitude/technical questions were pretty hard.
The test was pretty hard, I would say.There was a proper and equal emphasis on C++, JAVA, Networking, OS, DBMS,UNIX.
The coding question was pretty tough as it was to find all increasing subsequences of given array of length k.
