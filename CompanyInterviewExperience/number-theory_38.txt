Given a number n, find the number of ways to represent this number as a sum of 2 or more consecutive natural numbers.
Examples :
We have already discussed one approach in below post.
Count ways to express a number as sum of consecutive numbers
Here a new approach is discussed.  Suppose that we are talking about the sum of numbers from X to Y ie [X, X+1, â€¦, Y-1, Y]
Then the arithmetic sum is 
If this should be N, then 
Note that one of the factors should be even and the other should be odd because Y-X+1 and Y+X should have opposite parity because Y-X and Y+X have the same parity.  Since 2N is anyways even, we find the number of odd factors of N.
For example, n = 15 all odd factors of 15 are 1 3 and 5 so the answer is 3.
