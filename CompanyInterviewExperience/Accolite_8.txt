    He had first kept my CV, which made me think that I might have made it as they were returning back the CVs of the students who were not selected. But later he called someone and asked him to return me my CV. From 23, only 4 were selected for the further rounds and unfortunately I didnâ€™t make it. (Even if only 1 person is selected in any round, he has to go through the remaining rounds. That is, the company might even reject that 1 candidate and return empty handed) But the interview was a good experience and there are very few companies having such an interview. I thoroughly had a good experience despite not being selected. Moreover, am still searching for answer for the 3rd question and also if anyone could solve the last question in linear complexity approach, please comment.
