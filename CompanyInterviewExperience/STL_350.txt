Stacks are a type of container adaptors with LIFO(Last In First Out) type of working, where a new element is added at one end and (top) an element is removed from that end only.
push() function is used to insert an element at the top of the stack. The element is added to the stack container and the size of the stack is increased by 1.

Examples:
Errors and Exceptions

2. Shows no exception throw guarantee if the parameter doesn’t throw any exception.

Application :
Given a number of integers, add them to the stack and find the size of the stack without using size function.
Algorithm
1. Push the given elements to the stack container one by one.
2. Keep popping the elements of stack until it becomes empty, and increment the counter variable.
3. Print the counter variable.
