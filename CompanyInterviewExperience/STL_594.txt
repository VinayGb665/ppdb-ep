Type Inference refers to automatic deduction of the data type of an expression in a programming language. Before C++ 11, each data type needs to be explicitly declared at compile time, limiting the values of an expression at runtime but after the new version of C++, many keywords are included which allows a programmer to leave the type deduction to the compiler itself.
With type inference capabilities, we can spend less time having to write out things compiler already knows. As all the types are deduced in compiler phase only, the time for compilation increases slightly but it does not affect the run time of the program.

auto keyword

The auto keyword specifies that the type of the variable that is being declared will be automatically deducted from its initializer. In case of functions, if their return type is auto then that will be evaluated by return type expression at runtime.
Run on IDE
Output : 
We have used typeid for getting the type of the variables. typeid is an operator which is used where dynamic type of an object need to be known. typeid(x).name() return shorthand name of the data type of x, for example, it return i for integers, d for doubles, Pi for the pointer to integer etc. But actual name returned is mostly compiler dependent. You can read more about typeid here.
 
A good use of auto is to avoid long initializations when creating iterators for containers.
Run on IDE
Output : 
Note : auto becomes int type if even an integer reference is assigned to it.  To make it reference type, we use auto &.
 
decltype Keyword
It inspects the declared type of an entity or the type of an expression. Auto lets you declare a variable with particular type whereas decltype lets you extract the type from the variable so decltype is sort of an operator that evaluates the type of passed expression.
    Explanation of above keyword and their uses is given below
Run on IDE
Output: 
Below is one more example to demonstrate the use of decltype
Run on IDE
Output: 
A program that demonstrates use of both auto and decltype.
Below is a C++ template function min_type() that returns minimum of two numbers.  The two numbers can be of any integral type.  The return type is determined using type of minimum of two.
