Round 1: The first was mcq test related to Java. Complete Java(what is the output type of problems,no theory but oops concepts should be understood perfectly), 35 questions in 1 hr.
Round 2: The only thing we discussed is my BTP.  I should’ve prepared well to explain him in a better way. I know the stuff but couldn’t explain him properly. Confidence and communication skills are really important for UBS. Then he asked me to code a question. Given and array of numbers representing time taken by various tasks. You have to allot the tasks to n persons such that all of them should get nearly equal work. Tasks have to be allotted in sequence for a person. I tried to code but couldn’t get the perfect logic, later he said use statistics to make it simple. But nothing happened. Rejected.
