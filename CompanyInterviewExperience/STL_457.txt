Prerequisite: std::search
std::search_n is an STL algorithm defined inside the header file , which is used to search whether a given element satisfies a predicate (equality if no such predicate is defined ) a given no. of times consecutively with the container elements.
It searches the range [first, last) for a sequence of count elements, each comparing equal to a given value (version 1) or satisfying a predicate (version 2).
The function returns an iterator to the first of such elements, or an iterator to the last element of the container, if no such sequence is found.
The two versions of std::search_n are defined as below â€“
