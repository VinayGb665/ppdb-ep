2) Given a graph where every two nodes are either friends or enemies with each other. Find a way to go from one node to the other.
Restrictions:
1) You can also travel from one node to next if they are friends with each other
2) You have some “magic potions”. You can convert an enemy path to a friend path with a magic potion.

F2F round 2:
1) Discuss one good, one bad feature of facebook. How you will redesign it to improve it?
2) Implement auto complete.
3) Given numbers a1…an find the minimum index, whose element occurs twice in the array. Do it in one pass of the array ( or less that O(n) if possible?)
e.g 3 2 4 4 2
Output : 1 (is the lowest Index) since, ‘2’ repeats twice.
Follow up:
Return the element that repeats at the earliest in the array. Output: 4
