Given a number n find the smallest number evenly divisible by each number 1 to n.
Examples:
If you observe carefully the ans must be the LCM of the numbers 1 to n.
To find LCM of numbers from 1 to n â€“
Note : In C++ code, the answer quickly exceeds the integer limit, even the long long limit.
Below is the implementation of the logic.

The above solution works fine for single input. But if we have multiple inputs, it is a good idea to use Sieve of Eratosthenes to store all prime factors. Please refer below article for Sieve based approach.
