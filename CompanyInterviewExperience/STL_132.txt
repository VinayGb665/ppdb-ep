The map::equal_range() is a built-in function in C++ STL which returns an iterator of pairs. The pair refers to the bounds of a range that includes all the elements in the container which have a key equivalent to k. Since the map container only contains unique key, hence the first iterator in the pair returned thus points to the element and the second iterator in the pair points to the next key which comes after key K. If there are no matches with key K, the range returned is of length 1 with both iterators pointing to the an element which has a key denoting the size of map and elements as 0. 
Syntax:  
Parameters: This function accepts a single mandatory parameter key which specifies the element whose range in the container is to be returned.   
Return Value: The function returns an iterator of pairs as explained above.
