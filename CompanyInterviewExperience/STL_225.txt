std::hermite is based on the hermite polynomial function given by: 

After solving the Hermite’s Polynomial, the results come out to be like the following table:
Examples: 

Input: n = 2 x = 7
Output: 194
Formula for n = 2,
4x7x7 – 2 = 196 – 2 = 194
Input: n = 4 x = 12
Output: 324876
Formula for n = 4,
16x12x12x12x12 – 48x12x12 + 12 = 324876

Syntax:
Parameters: The function accepts two mandatory parameters which are described below: 
Return value: This function returns the value which is the answer to the hermite’s polynomial.
Note: The std::hermite() function runs on GCC 7.1 (C++ 17) version.
