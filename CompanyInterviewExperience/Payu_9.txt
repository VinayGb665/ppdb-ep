Here’s my interview experience at PayU india (fresher). 
Round 1
Firstly, a discussion of projects in resume and a detailed chat on my internship
1. Search for an element in a pivoted array. (Only logic and pseudo code )
2. Find middle node of a linked list. (Tested a lot by asking questions)
This round didn’t go well as I was not good at OS and DBMS. So, prepare those sections as well apart from DSA. I was rejected after this round.
