Hi, I recently appeared for the 1st round of Directi’s recruitment process. Students were divided into 2 slots. The questions for the slots were as follows :

SLOT 1 :-

SLOT 2 :-
I solved 2 questions and knew the algorithm correctly but missed some edge case, and simply received “wrong answer”. No consideration to partial test cases.
Overall a very difficult experience for us. Only 1 student cleared this round. He was able to solve only 1 question and that too because he had solved the question earlier. Mostly he was selected because he had a CGPA above 9.5.
