Priority Queue is an extension of the queue with following properties.
1) An element with high priority is dequeued before an element with low priority.
2) If two elements have the same priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.
Below is simple implementation of priority queue.

Note that the time complexity of delete is O(n) in above code. 
A better implementation is to use Binary Heap which is typically used to implement priority queue. Note that Python provides heapq in library also.
