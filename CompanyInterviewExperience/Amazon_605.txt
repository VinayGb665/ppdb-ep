Amazon Interview (Off campus for SDE-1)
Experience: 8 months 
Interview Process â€“ 2 (telephonic) + 3 (f2f â€“ Bangalore) + 1 bar raiser (telephonic)
Telephonic 1 (25 minutes only)
Q1. Two strings s1 and s2 are given; find a minimal length substring in s1 which does not contain s2 as a substring. (Do include all edge cases)
Q2. Swap all nodes of a linked list with their next nodes.
Telephonic 2 (65 -70 minutes)
Q1. An integer array of size n is A[] given, find the three numbers s.t. A[i] > A[j] > A[k] and I < j < k.(algo only)
Q2. An array of integers is given, trim the array such that 2*min > max. min and max are the minimum and maximum elements of the array. You can remove elements either from start or from end of the array if above condition does not meet. No of removals should be minimum. (algo + code)
For example a, b, c, d, e f are the elements of array, c is the min num and e is max no
condition 2*c > e is true then we are done but if false then remove either from start i.e. a,b,c or from end i.e. e, f such that new min or max would satisfy the condition and removals should be minimum.
Q3. A sorted array of integers and a number K is given, find the closet number to K. (algo only)
F2F 1 (60 minutes)
