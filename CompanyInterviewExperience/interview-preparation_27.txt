Dear Prof Chatterjee,
As a student representative of our college, I would like to invite your institute into the technical Symposium that is about to be held in our college next Sunday.  Many eminent personalities would be visiting the Symposium just like the previous years. We are planning for a huge success this year too and are expecting a huge participation from your esteemed institution. The symposium would introduce to the mass about the latest technologies, followed by stalls set up to show demos on Science projects. It would be a great platform for interaction on some interesting topics with some of the eminent personalities. Participants can complete their registrations before the upcoming Sunday.
It is a great opportunity to exchange ideas and win exciting prizes. Looking forward to a great participation.
Thanks and regards,
