You are given a function f(n) = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4), you have to find the value of f(n) mod 5 for any given value of positive integer n.
Note: n may be large enough, such that f(n) > 1018.
Examples :

First of all for solving this approach you may find the value of (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4) mod 5 directly with the help of anypower function and modulo operator.
But For the larger value of n, your result will be wrong because for large n value of f(n) may go out of range from long long int in that case you have to opt some other efficient way.
To solve this question lets do some small mathematical derivation for f(n).
After above analysis we can see that if n is of form 5k+1 or say 5k-4 then f(n) mod 5 = 4, other wise f(n) = 0.
I.E. if(n%5 == 1 ) result = 4,
else result = 0.
