First round (online round,)
It had some 15 mcq questions, most of it was technical, had questions from almost all CS subjects we learnt in college. I was lucky enough to guess most of the questions correctly and so was called for the coding round.
Second round
For the selected students, there was a coding round which had 2 standard questions in data structures, from GeeksforGeeks.org. I solved one question fully with all test cases working, and later results were out after 1 month. I was lucky again to get through this round without having the solve one program by solving only one program….
Third round
The next round was a group fly round(written programming round) which was to be followed by technical in person interviews. These rounds were held in Bangalore.
 In – Person Interview
A quick-brief introduction. We spoke In and out about my project, and also he wanted to see my app in my phone. He asked few basic questions about the project implementation.
Later he gave me a technical question, Fold and merge a linked list….I was comparatively little less nervous now, but was still not very good in paper coding…..made lots of mistakes but somehow wrote some code….but there were few mistakes here and there which i found and corrected when he pointed it out to me…But this time i wasn’t lucky enough and was rejected after this round.
