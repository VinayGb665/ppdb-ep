Given an array, the task is to find to LIS (Longest Increasing Subsequence) in a circular way.
Examples :

As in the last window we will have the same elements as in the given array which we donâ€™t need to compute again, so we can append only n-1 elements to reduce the number of operations.

Time complexity of above solution is O(n3). It can be reduced O(n2 Log n) using O(n Log n) algorithm to find LIS.
