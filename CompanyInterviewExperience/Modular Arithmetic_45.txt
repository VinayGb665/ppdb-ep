M items are to be delivered in a circle of size M. Find the position where the M-th item will be delivered if we start from a given position K.  Note that items are distributed at adjacent positions starting from K.
Examples :

We check if the number of items to be distributed is greater than our remaining positions in current cycle of circle or not. If yes, then we simply return m + k â€“ 1 (We distribute items in same cycle starting from k). Else we compute number of remaining items after completing current cycle and return mod of remaining items.
Below is the implementation of the above idea
