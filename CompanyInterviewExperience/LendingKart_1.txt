Round 1: Given 3 strings write the code to check if 3rd string is shuffle of the first two strings. Third string is said to be a shuffle of first and second if it can be formed by interleaving the characters of first and second String in a way that maintains the left to right ordering of the characters from each string. Example: katrina, kareena, katkareerinana. Here katkareerinana (“kat” + ”karee” + ”rina” + ”na” ) is shuffle of  katrina (“kat” + “rina”) and kareena (“karee” + “na”).
