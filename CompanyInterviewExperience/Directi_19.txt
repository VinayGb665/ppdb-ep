K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection.
It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning, it does not make any underlying assumptions about the distribution of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data).
We are given some prior data (also called training data), which classifies coordinates into groups identified by an attribute.
As an example, consider the following table of data points containing two features:

Now, given another set of data points (also called testing data), allocate these points a group by analyzing the training set. Note that the unclassified points are marked as ‘yellow’.

Intuition
If we plot these points on a graph, we may be able to locate some clusters, or groups. Now, given an unclassified point, we can assign it to a group by observing what group its nearest neighbours belong to. This means, a point close to a cluster of points classified as ‘Red’ has a higher probability of getting classified as ‘Red’.
Intuitively, we can see that the first point (2.5, 7) should be classified as ‘Blue’ and the second point (5.5, 4.5) should be classified as ‘Red’.
Algorithm
Let m be the number of training data samples. Let p be an unknown point.

K can be kept as an odd number so that we can calculate a clear majority in the case where only two groups are possible (e.g. Red/Blue). With increasing K, we get smoother, more defined boundaries across different classifications. Also, the accuracy of the above classifier increases as we increase the number of data points in the training set.
Example Program
Assume 0 and 1 as the two classifiers (groups).
