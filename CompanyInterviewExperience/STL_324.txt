Array classes are generally more efficient, light-weight and reliable than C-style arrays. The introduction of array class from C++11 has offered a better alternative for C-style arrays.
This operator is used to reference the element present at position given inside the operator. It is similar to the at() function, the only difference is that the at() function throws an out-of-range exception when the position is not in the bounds of the size of array, while this operator causes undefined behaviour.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. If the position is not present in the array, it shows undefined behaviour.
2. It has a no exception throw guarantee otherwise.

Output:
Application
Given an array of integers, print all the integers present at even positions.
Algorithm
1. Run a loop till  the size of the array.
2. Check if the position is divisible by 2, if yes, print the element at that position.
