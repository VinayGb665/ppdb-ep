I have just entered my third year and Amazon was the first company to visit our campus for Software Internship. The process was :
ONLINE ROUND
2 Coding questions and 20 MCQs . The coding questions were:
I had practised MCQS from http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/quiz-corner/  and many of the MCQs I had seen here before that were asked in the test. Sorting, hashing, complexity, recursion based MCQs were asked .
Also, 2 questions on OS , 1 on Networking and 1 on DBMS was present . I did not attempt these since there was negative marking . I solved around 14-15 MCQs and both the coding questions . (However, some students completing 1 were also selected .)
1. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/serialize-deserialize-binary-tree/
2. Spiral level order traversal of a binary tree from bottom level to top level.( I was allowed to use extra space(O(n)) .)
ROUND 2
This round was easier than the previous one for me and went smooth .
I would like to thank GeeksforGeeks for providing a huge set of problems for practicing for interviews. The internship archives were extremely helpful . Also I practiced on https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/ and interviewbit regularly in the summer break.
