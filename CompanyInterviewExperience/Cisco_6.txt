I got a call from Cisco Systems, Bangalore for Software Engineer role.
Total rounds: Hackerrank Test+ 3(Tech) + 1 (Managerial)
Hackerrank test is pretty standard Linked List, arrays, trees.

Round 1: Lot of questions from the resume, implement IPC on threads, Linked List questions, various IPCs, implement mutex locks.

Round 3: Resume projects, hell lot of questions

Round 4: (Managerial) About the role, Why do you want to switch so early?, Mostly critical bug you have solved?, Why Cisco?
