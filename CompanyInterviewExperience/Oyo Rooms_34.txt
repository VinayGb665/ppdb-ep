Round 1: Online Coding Round – 90 min
There were 30 MCQ based on data structures and OS. Also, there were two coding questions.
First was given an array of movie ratings (-10 to 10), a person can flip exactly k ratings (-ve to +ve or vice versa). One rating can be flipped more than once. Find maximum possible total rating of the movie.
The second was given an array containing time taken by ith person to complete one circular round of a track. two persons exchange a gem if they cross each other on the track. All the persons start from the same initial position. Find the number of exchanges after k minutes.
35 students were shortlisted after this round.

The interviewer asked about my internship – project done, learnings etc. Then I was given a problem related to decibinary system. After that, a basic conceptual problem was asked related to process and threads.
20 students were shortlisted after this round.

Round 3: Technical Interview 2
The interviewer discussed projects on my cv in detail. After that, he gave me a question on searching in a rotated sorted array in one binary search. After that, he tested my knowledge of data structures by asking basic conceptual questions on queues, linked lists, and arrays.
Around 13 people were shortlisted after this round.

Round 4: Technical Interview 3
