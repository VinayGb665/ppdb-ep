The Simple solution of this problem is to use two for loops. The outer loop considers current character, the inner loop counts occurrences of current character. If the count goes beyond current maximum count, we update the result.

An efficient solution is to run only one loop. The idea is to reset the count as 1 as soon as we find a character not matching with previous.
