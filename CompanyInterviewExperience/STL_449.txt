For calculating the largest of all the elements in a given list, we have std::max, but what if we want to find the largest element not in the whole list, but in a sub-section of the list. To serve this purpose, we have std::max_element in C++.

std::max_element is defined inside the header file  and it returns an iterator pointing to the element with the largest value in the range [first, last).
std::max_element can be used in two ways. The comparisons can be performed either usingoperator < (first version), or using a pre-defined function (second version). If more than one element satisfies the condition of being the largest, the iterator returned points to the first of such elements.
The two versions are defined as given below:
