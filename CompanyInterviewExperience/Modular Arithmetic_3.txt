Given an integer N, the task is to print all the substring of N without doing any conversion i.e converting it into a string or an array.
Examples:

Input: N = 12345
Output: Possible Substrings: {1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 2, 23, 234, 2345, 3, 34, 345, 4, 45, 5}
Input: N = 123
Output: Possible Substrings: {1, 12, 123, 2, 23, 3}
