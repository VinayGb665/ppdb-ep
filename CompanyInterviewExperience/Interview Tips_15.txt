It takes time and effort to build up a nice resume, to become a perfect candidate for a post in your dream company.
Months of training in a particular field of tech and carrying out the projects, along with your college study and extra co-curricular activities. So, when the time finally comes for you to present yourself in front of an elite panelist sometimes you might not be ready for it. You may get nervous and mess one or two questions, especially if it’s the first time. They may need only a couple of candidates and they miss out on you. So, you get depressed for some time.
But do not let that decrease your momentum of growth. It has happened to me. They said “We will get back to you, ” I felt like a loser. Later I realized that we should not get hopeless but learn from our mistakes. Even if u fail 100 interviews don’t be shy to try out one more. it’s the only way that will keep your dream alive and your career on a positive note. If u have a goal, don’t give up. Reach out to people and get things done. Move past rejections. So, instead of being upset, make more calls, reach out to more people and end the day with a home run.    
Always be grateful for what you have. Sometimes “rejection is protection” of what’s not worthy of you. There will always be an organization that will acknowledge your value and skills. Keep going and never give up.
