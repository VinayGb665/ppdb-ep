Hello guys, I am having a 1.3 year of experience and I applied in Paytm money for software engineer profile.
Round 1: online test.
Round 2: all algorithm questions.
Round 3: algorithm + java + spring boot framework.
Round 4: projects + 1 algorithm + query optimization.
Online test(1 hrs):-
   1. Coin change problem modified version, time O(n*n).
   2. Balanced parenthesis problem, and print longest braces length, time O(n).
Algorithm:-
Java:-
   1. Internal implementation of HashMap.
   2. Difference b/w Abstract and interface.
   3. write a custom class to achieve Mutability.
   4. Java multithreading with both approach differences.
Spring boot:-
   1. Dependencies of injection, inversion of control.
   2. Some annotations.
   3. What’s the problem we are facing without Dependencies of injection.
Project:-
   1. Ask current working project with some internal and deeper discussion.
   2. Query optimization and some internal working of the database which I was using in my current project.
Optimize the query:-
Select a, b, c from table where d=* and e=*;
