You are given two positive numbers M and N. The task is to print greatest common divisor of M’th and N’th Fibonacci Numbers.
The first few Fibonacci Numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ….
Note that 0 is considered as 0’th Fibonacci Number.
Examples:

A Simple Solution is to follow below steps.
1) Find M’th Fibonacci Number.
2) Find N’th Fibonacci Number.
3) Return GCD of two numbers.
A Better Solution is based on below identity
The steps are:
1) Find GCD of M and N. Let GCD be g.
2) Return Fib(g).
