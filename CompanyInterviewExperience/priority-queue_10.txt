Given a Binary tree, the task is to print its all level in sorted order
Examples:

Here we can use two Priority queue for print in sorted order.  We create an empty queue q and two priority queues, current_level and next_level.  We use NULL as a separator between two levels. Whenever we encounter NULL in normal level order traversal, we swap current_level and next_level.
