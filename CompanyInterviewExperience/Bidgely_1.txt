Given an array of n elements. Find maximum sum of pairwise multiplications. Sum can be larger so take mod with 10^9+7.  If there are odd elements, then we can add any one element (without forming a pair) to the sum.
Examples:
1- Sort the given array.
2- First, multiply the negative numbers pairwise from the starting and add to the total_sum.
3- Second, multiply the positive numbers pairwise from the last and to the total_sum.
4- Check if negative and positive both counts are odd, then add the product of last pair
 i.e. last negative and positive left.
5- Or if any of the one counts is odd, then add that element left.
6- Return sum.
