Total of 5 rounds 
1. Written â€“ 20 questions (15 from C,DS and algorithms and 5 form OS),
2. Technical Interview â€“ No Introduction directly they have take into technical discussion.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a. write a function which will return the length of the string. the function should return only length(i.e interger), and u should not use any varialbles(i used recursion).
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b. revrse a string without using any variable, here you can use your previous defined ur own length function.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c. some basic questions on pointers, errors, outputs.

3. Technical Interview â€“ Completely on Data structures and algorithms
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a. merge two linked lists with O(n) complexity.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b. BST
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â c. A general scenario and we should design it.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â d. Some basic DS and algos questions like search algos and sorting algos, pros and cons of recursion and iteration.

4. Technical interview â€“ Again on C
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â a. Hashing questions,
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â b. anagrams problem with efficient algorithm.
Â Â Â Â Â c. arranging the array in ascending order where array condtains randow 1â€™s and 0â€™s. (some how I impressed the interviewer with different approches).

5. HR round â€“ Only on package discussion
Interviewers are awesome, they will help u to the maximum. Interact with them, ask them some clues, thats it as simple as that.
last but not least thanks GeekforGeeks without u guys I would not have made it far.
keep rocking guys ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚ ðŸ™‚
