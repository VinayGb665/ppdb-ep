I gave him difference approach aand he was satisfied with that. He asked me to code the function.
2. Write a program to calculate the power function(i.e x raised to the power y)
I first gave 0(y) solution .Then he asked me to improve . So i gave him 0(log(y)) solution. He was satisfied with my solution. He asked me to code it.
3. Given a number n ,all numbers are present from 1 to n except one number. Find the missing number.
