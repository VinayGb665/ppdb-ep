Round 1: Pen and Paper test on Aptitude and C, C++ Fill in the blanks ( mainly focused on tracing Recursions and Pointers ). Duration – 1:30 hrs
Around 1500 students appeared out of which only 250 got selected for next round.
Round 2: Competitive coding in our campus labs offline. Duration – 3 to 5 hours
There are five questions to solve.Even if you solve 3 you will get into next round.Anyone can solve 2 questions so question selection is important here.They observe the following in code :
The questions range is hacker-rank’s medium level and some are easy.No language restriction but Java is preferred.Some invigilators won’t accept to use inbuilt functions and libraries.
Round 3: System Design and Development.Duration – 3 to 5 hours
Our task was to implement Kanzo Interpreter .It’s basically 5 Levels, in each level we have to build a module which leads to final task.
They won’t expect complete implementation, they observe the approach.Chances for next round are very high if the mentor likes your code.Again language is not a restriction but Java is preferred and expected by them.
