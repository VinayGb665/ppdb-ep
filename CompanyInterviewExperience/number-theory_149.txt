Given a number n, we need to calculate the sum of divisors of factorial of the number.
Examples:
A Simple Solution is to first compute factorial of given number, then count number divisors of the factorial. This solution is not efficient and may cause overflow due to factorial computation.

An efficient solution is based on Legendre’s formula. Below are the steps.
The value of largest power that divides p is floor value of each term n/p + n/(p2) + n/(p3) + ……
Let these values be exp1, exp2, exp3, .. Using the above formula, we get below values for n = 6.
