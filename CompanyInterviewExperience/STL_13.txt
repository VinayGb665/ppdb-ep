The strtoimax() function in C++ interprets the contents of a string as an integral number of the specified base and return its value as an intmax_t(maximum width integer). This function also sets an end pointer that points to the first character after the last valid numeric character of the string, if there is no such character then the pointer is set to null. This function is defined in cinttypes header file.
