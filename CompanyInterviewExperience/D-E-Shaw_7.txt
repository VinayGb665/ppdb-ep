Round 1: 
It was a coding test on HackerRank platform. Two simple algorithmic questions were asked there which required basic knowledge on STL (for C++) and Maths. Test duration was 45 minutes.
Question 1: A string representing HTML tags are given. Find if corresponding HTML tags are equal or not. Return 1 for true and 0 for false cases.
Example – 1 <HTML><HEAD></HTML></HEAD> return true. (Yea, order doesn’t matter)
Example -2 <HTML><HEAD></HEAD></HEAD> return false.
Question 2: Given a number N, find the k’th character in m’th shortest permutation of sequence 1, 2, 3….N.
Example: N=3, k=2, m=2.
1 2 3
1 3 2
2 1 3
2 3 1
3 1 2
3 2 1
These will be the permutations, now the 2nd character of 2nd permutation will be 3.
Round 2:
After coding test, 22 people were shortlisted for Interviews. There were two Interviews for me. First Interview was a telephonic one, which lasted for about 2.5 hours.
Questions included in Interview-1:
Questions included in Interview-2:
Round 3: 
Round-3 was HR round. Questions were very easy. It included-
In the last, HR told me about that my performance had been good so far and most probably, I will be selected into it.
Result- Selected.
