11. Given a set of numbers like a = 1, b = 4, c = 7, d = 11, and a target number T = 6. You need to find out the neighbours of target T from the given set of numbers.
    Now here 4 and 7 is neighbour of T. The output should be in the format : “The neighbours are b and c”. Note that b = 4 and c = 7.
    The set may be large.
    You cannot use any STL containers or any STL functions like binary search, etc.
    You have to write the naive code for the above.
    If you wrote the code in one way, he would ask you to write in another way. Explain the code.
12. Given a string 1234ACVDSqwerr1234@&. You need to print all the digits, uppercase letters, lower case letters seperately, nothing to do with the symbols.
13. What are pointers? What are advantages and disadvantages of pointers?
14. Do you think java is better than c++? Why does java do not have pointers? How does java overcome the need of having pointers?
15. If you had to make one library, how would you know which part of your code should be private, public or protected? Why would you make it private, public or
    protected?
16. Do you play sports? Are you good at any sports?
