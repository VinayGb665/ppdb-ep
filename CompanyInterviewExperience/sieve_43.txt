Given a positive integers ‘q’ and ‘n’. For each query ‘q’ find whether a number ‘n’ have exactly four distinct divisors or not. If the number have exactly four divisors then print ‘Yes’ else ‘No’.1 <= q, n <= 106 
Simple approach is to count factors by generating all divisors of a number by using this approach, after that check whether the count of all factors are equal to ‘4’ or not. Time complexity of this approach is O(sqrt(n)).   
Better approach is to use Number theory. For a number to be have four factors, it must satisfy the following conditions:-
We can use sieve of Eratosthenes such that we will pre-calculate all the prime factor from 1 to 106. Now we will mark all numbers which are the product of two prime number by using two ‘for loops’ i.e, mark[p * q] =true. Meanwhile we will also mark all numbers(cube root) by taking cube of number i.e, mark[p * p * p] = true.
After that we can easily answer each query in O(1) time.
Below is pseudo code, have a look for better understanding
