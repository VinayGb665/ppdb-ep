The sequence first consists of all the odd numbers starting from 1 to n and then remaining even numbers starting 2 up to n. Let’s suppose we have n as 1000. Then the sequence becomes 1 3 5 7….999 2 4 6….1000
We are given a range (L, R), we need to find sum of numbers of this sequence in given range.
Note: Here the range is given as (L, R) L and R are included in the range
Examples:
The idea is to first find sum of numbers before left(excluding left), then find sum of numbers before right (including right).  We get result as second sum minus first sum.
How to find sum till a limit?
We first count how many odd numbers are there, then we use formulas for sum of odd natural numbers and sum of even natural numbers to find the result.
How to find count of odd numbers?
By simple observation, we get the number of odd numbers is ceil(n/2). So, the number of even numbers are n – ceil(n/2).
For a given number x how will we find the sum in the sequence from 1 to x?
let’s suppose x is less than the number of odd numbers.
If the x is greater then the number of odd numbers
