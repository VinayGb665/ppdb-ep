Amazon visited our campus for summer internship. I prepared from Amazon Interview Sets which were pretty helpful!

Here is my experience :


DAY 1
They had an online aptitude test on day 1. It was 90 minutes: 20 MCQs + 2 coding questions (choice between C/C++/Java for coding). MCQs were based on DSA, OS, and Math. They were apparently difficult. 
Two Coding Questions :
1. Keypad problem – Little difficult problem on backtracking.
2. Given an array, find the count of impossible triangle
Day 2:
Surprise aptitude test:
2 coding questions 60 mins. 
Questions involved DSA and strongly based on optimising the code:
1. Given a linked list, reverse K nodes in it 
 eg :- 1->2->3->4->5->NULL , k = 3
 3->2->1->5->4 


2. Search for an element in an array which has elements who’s values are first increasing and then decreasing. (Use modified binary search)


2 One-on-one Interview rounds, both technical. 
Try giving THE most optimal algorithm which satisfies edge cases too.
I was told to write the code on the paper. 
Questions asked to me were:
 
First interview round
1. Find the second largest element in an array.
2. Given a sorted array which can have repeated elements, find the occurrence of an element. (Most optimal solution is O(logn) – Using binary search to find start and end occurrence)
3. Make a data structure and implement an algorithm to print all the files in a directory. (the root directory can have sub-directories too.)
 I used an n-ary tree and BFS to print files. It can also be done using Stack.
 
Second interview round
1. He asked some question about my CV
2. Print a matrix diagonally.
3. DFS of binary tree, n-ary tree.
4. Then he asked some question from other subjects.
 OS – Scheduling 
 DBMS – Normalization, Transaction
 OOPS – Abstraction
