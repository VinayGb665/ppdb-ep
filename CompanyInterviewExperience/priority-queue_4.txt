Given k sorted arrays of possibly different sizes, merge them and print the sorted output.
Examples:
We have discussed a solution that works for all arrays of same size in Merge k sorted arrays | Set 1.
A simple solution is to create an output array and and one by one copy all arrays to it. Finally, sort the output array using. This approach takes O(N Logn N) time where N is count of all elements.
An efficient solution is to use heap data structure.  The time complexity of heap based solution is O(N Log k).
1. Create an output array.
2. Create a min heap of size k and insert 1st element in all the arrays into the heap
3. Repeat following steps while priority queue is not empty.
…..a) Remove minimum element from heap (minimum is always at root) and store it in output array.
…..b) Insert next element from the array from which the element is extracted. If the array doesn’t have any more elements, then do nothing.
