Interview consists of one written and two technical rounds followed by HR round.
Written Test : Total 50 questions
Aptitude : 20
Technical : 30
cutoff : 29 marks.  aptitude – around 9,10, Technical – 22  
Aptitude Questions : 
[Mainly covered on topics like basic probability question, functions, propositional logic, finding number with help of statement, simple passage, basic permutation]
1. Aptitude means everyone starts with speed and distance, train problems, boats and cisterns, Time and work but here there was no questions on these topics.
2. Simple questions on conditional probability like
X having 5 chips with 1 defective, Y having 4 chips with 2 defective  what is the probability of selecting 1 defective chip out of 9 chips that to from Y.
3. simple problems on Propositional logic
p->q V p->r how many set of values for this logic gives true value
Ans – 7
4. two set {1,2,3,4} and {4,5} total number of elements in cartestian product of these two sets.
5. If a digit square is divided by half of the number then its quotient is divided by and it is added by 36 then…. you can search questions of this type.
6. Two white ball and 3 red ball in box a, 3 red and 4 white in box b, probability of selecting white ball from box b.
7. Simple passage questions.
