Given N and M, task is to find whether numbers 1 to N can be divided into two sets such that the absolute difference between the sum of two sets is M and gcd of the sum of two sets is 1 (i.e. Sum of both sets are co-prime). 
Prerequisite : GCD in CPP | GCD
Examples :
Input : N = 5 and M = 7
Output : YES
Explanation :  as numbers from 1 to 5 can be divided into two sets {1, 2, 3, 5} and {4} such that absolute difference between the sum of both sets is 11 – 4 = 7 which is equal to M and also GCD(11, 4) = 1.
Input :  N = 6 and M = 3
Output : NO
Explanation : In this case, Numbers from 1 to 6 can be divided into two sets {1, 2, 4, 5} and {3, 6} such that absolute difference between their sum is 12 – 9 = 3. But, since 12 and 9 are not co-prime as GCD(12, 9) = 3, the answer is ‘NO’.
Approach : Since we have 1 to N numbers, we know that the sum of all the numbers is N * (N + 1) / 2. Let S1 and S2 be two sets such that,
1) sum(S1) + sum(S2) = N * (N + 1) / 2
2) sum(S1) – sum(S2) = M
Solving these two equations will give us the sum of both the sets. If sum(S1) and sum(S2) are integers and they are co-prime (their GCD is 1), then there exists a way to split the numbers into two sets. Otherwise, there is no way to split these N numbers.
Below is the implementation of the solution described above.
