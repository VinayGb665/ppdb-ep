Given two integers N and D, Find a set of N integers such that difference between their product and sum is equal to D.
Examples :

A tricky solution is to keep the difference D to choose N numbers as N-2 ‘1’s, one ‘2’ and one remaining number as ‘N+D’.
   Sum = (N-2)*(1) + 2 + (N+D) = 2*N + D.
   Product = 1*2*(N+D) = 2*N+2*D
   Difference = (2*N+2*D) – (2*N+D) = D.
