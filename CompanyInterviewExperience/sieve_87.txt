Given an array arr[] such that 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^12, the task is to find prime factors of LCM of array elements.
Examples:

A simple solution for this problem is to find LCM of n elements in array. First initialize lcm = 1, then iterate for each element in array and find the lcm of previous result with new element using formula LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b) i.e., lcm  = (lcm  * arr[i]) / gcd(lcm, arr[i]). After finding LCM of all n elements we can calculate all prime factors of LCM.
Since here constraint are large, we can not implement above method to solve this problem because while calculating LCM(a, b) we need to calculate a*b and if a,b both are of value 10^12 so it will exceed the limit of  integer size. We proceed for this problem in another way using sieve of sundaram and prime factorization of a number. As we know if LCM(a,b) = k so any prime factor of a or b will also be the prime factor of â€˜kâ€™.
Below is C++ implementation of above idea.
