The multimap::equal_range() is a built-in function in C++ STL which returns an iterator of pairs. The pair refers to the bounds of a range that includes all the elements in the container which have a key equivalent to k. If there are no matches with key K, the range returned is of length 0 with both iterators pointing to the first element that has a key considered to go after k according to the container’s internal comparison object (key_comp). 
Syntax:  
Parameters: This function accepts a single mandatory parameter key which specifies the element whose range in the container is to be returned.   
Return Value: The function returns an iterator of pairs. The pair refers to the bounds of a range that includes all the elements in the container which have a key equivalent to k. If there are no matches with key K, the range returned is of length 0 with both iterators pointing to the first element that has a key considered to go after k according to the container’s internal comparison object (key_comp).
