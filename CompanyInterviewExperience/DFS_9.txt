Given a connected graph, check if the graph is bipartite or not. A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color. Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors.  For example, see the following graph.

It is not possible to color a cycle graph with an odd cycle using two colors.

In the previous post, an approach using BFS has been discussed. In this post, an approach using DFS has been implemented. Given below is the algorithm to check for bipartiteness of a graph. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach: 
Run on IDE
Time Complexity: O(N)
Auxiliary Space: O(N)
