Deloitte visited IIT this placement season to hire consultants in Data Sciences Profile.
Round 1
Firstly, an online test was conducted(120 minutes duration) consisting of questions on Quantitative (30), Aptitude (30), Verbal (30) and Probability and Statistics (30). If you have prepared well, this won’t be very difficult. However, make sure you study on topics like Hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and statistical Inference for cracking the last section, in which the focus was on statistics.
Out of 900 students, 35 were shortlisted and they kept a waitlist of 15 students. Then, we had an online PPT in which the interviewers walked us through the various stages of interview
Next, There were 3 rounds of interviews.
HR Interview
My first round of interview was HR only and it was taken by the Director of the Analytics team and Actuaries team and it was more like a conversation. They first introduced themselves and asked me to do the same. Then, they asked me to walk them through the CV.
 Technical Interview
The interviewer was a very nice guy and he asked me how can I look so fresh during the placements and I cracked a joke about being naturally good looking.
Technical Interview -2 
He was an IIT alum from my department.
Finally, they selected 4 people out of the 35 and I was one of them. Last tip, although, Deloitte didn’t ask for algorithms, most companies do. So, do some coding and algorithms from geekforgeeks and Hackerrank. Overall, it was a good experience, and a memorable one too!
