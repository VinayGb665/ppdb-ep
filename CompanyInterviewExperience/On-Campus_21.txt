100+ students appeared for this online round out of which 82 were shortlisted for the second round.
Round 2: 
It is a technical round, it depends on the panel you attend and your resume. Since my resume is with ML and the interviewer also form the ML we began with the questions from ML related to my project. This is the thing they are expecting: whether you have done the project on your own without any plagiarism. I have explained my projects and the terms in them. And some other questions from SQL, Unix commands, OOPS and for a formality I asked the interviewer to ask me any coding questions, he then asked me to write a code for checking palindrome.
They are not expecting the Theoretical knowledge, only the practical application concepts. Not more than that. Evaluation is based on how fit enough you are to learn the technologies there.
Round 3:

Finally By 5:30 PM they announced the shortlisted candidates, There were 20 shortlisted candidates, 7 boys and 13 girls, Luckily I was one among them.
