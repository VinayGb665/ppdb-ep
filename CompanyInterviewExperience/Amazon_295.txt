I was interviewed in Delhi for SDE-I position in Kindle Frameworks Team at Amazon. I was working as a Project Lead in Samsung, Noida and had a total experience of 1 year 10 months in the Software Industry.
Round 1 : Written
There were about 80 candidates and the time allotted for this round is 1 hour. I was able to write all the 3 codes correctly in just 20 min and was the first candidate to move onto the second round.
Round 2 : Problem Solving (F2F)
Round 3 : Design and Data Structures (F2F)
The interviewer was highly impressed with my coding skills and shook hands with a sense of approval.
Round 4 : Hiring Manager (F2F)
The Hiring Manager introduced himself and told me that I’ve been doing really great till now. Then he grinned at me and said “ Lets hope you don’t mess it up in this round “ .
(1) Which Sorting Algorithm is the fastest and why would you prefer it over others ?
While telling the answer, I said in between “ If there would have been millions of numbers…… “ and he caught that specific word of mine “millions” and hence the next 2 questions found the way on their own.
He scrutinized the entire code for any possible errors and found it perfect.
Then he stood up and shook my hands with a broad smile and said “ Well Done Man ! ” and left.
Round 5 : Bar Raiser (F2F)
Only this question was asked in this round and the discussion went on for about 45 minutes.
