Given Binary matrix. Task is count all zeros which are surrounded by one (may not be immediate neighbor).
Note: here we are only taking four direction up, left, down, right.
Examples:

Idea is based on the DFS.
First we remove all the zero value cells in the matrix which are reachable from boundary of Matrix using DFS. Note that any cell which is reachable from a boundary 0 cell is not surrounded by ones. 
After that we count all zeros which are left in binary matrix.
Below c++ implementation of above idea. 
Run on IDE
Output:
Time Complexity: O(Row*Col)
