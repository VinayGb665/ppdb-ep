Morgan Stanley came for Full Time recruitment for Software Associate in our campus.
Round 1
Online test on HackerRank contains 19 MCQ (DS, OS, DBMS, and Reasoning etc.)2 Coding Questions
1.       Count the number of changes in LED Light when display one digit after another of a given number. (Initially all LED is off)
Example:
Given number – 082
Answer: 9
Explanation: Initially 0 has 6 LED On, then for 8 we will turn on 1 more LED, then for 2 we turn off two LEDs so 6+1+2 = 9.
2.       Given an array on n integers containing numbers 1,2,3 & 4 where
1 is No work is done
2 is A work is done
3 is B work is done
4 is either A or B work is done
Find the minimum number of free days such that no same work can take place two days simultaneously.
Those who done 1 coding question complete and at least 6 MCA correct are selected for next round.
23 are shortlisted for direct interview. I was one of them.

Round 2
Face to Face Technical Interview Round (50 minutes)
1.       Tell me about yourself?
2.       Discussion on 2nd coding question of round 1 with better approaches.
3.       Given 10 computers and 20 persons who want to use these computers, what type of scheduling you will use?
4.       What if a person using a computer ask for more time in between?

7.       Give a parking lot which can contain n cars at max. Each parking area is of different size. Only the car of that size can park in that area (neither smaller nor bigger).
Design a data structure with program on how you will tell the incoming cars to park at what position and also which cars you can neglect.
Example –
Park = {2,1,2,3,3,4,2,4,1} (Size of Park Area)
Cars = {1,2,5,1,2,4,2,3,2,1} (Size of Car)
Solution: Car – Index
1 – 1, 2 – 0, 5 – NA, 1 – 8, 2 – 2, 4 – 5, 2 – 6, 3 – 3, 2 – NA, 1 – NA
8.       Design a Database of student, subject and marks and describe various keys and attributes.

Some Questions asked to my Friends –
1.       What are Smart Pointer?
2.       What starts first when computer is turned on?
3.       Process state diagram with explanation?
