The recruitment process is comprised of the following three rounds:
Round 1: Online Exam Conducted on AMCAT

For Deloitte AMCAT I had studied from PrepInsta’s Deloitte Section here. I think around 30-40% questions in the exam were same from this website.
Round 2:
Group Discussion:
The number of participants in a group will range between 15 and 25. The members of a group are given a topic that needs to be discussed among the group. For example, the topic might be “Facebook should be banned in schools.” You are expected to present your views, supported by valid examples and reasons. Some times, the group discussion panel/moderators specifically ask a particular person to present his/her views in between the discussion. So be ready with your points on the given topic. This is an elimination round.
Round 3:
Personal Interview:
Technical questions on C, C++, Java, DBMS and operating systems are expected. In the HR round, the interview panel questions you everything and anything related to your personality, family, education, hobbies, internships, work experience (if relevant), general knowledge, etc.
Also study some Puzzles from here.
