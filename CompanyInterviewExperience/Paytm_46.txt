I attended a Paytm recruitment drive.
The requirement was for both Front-end and Backend Developers. I applied for Backend.
First there was a written round. The paper consists of 4 Sections.
1- C programming and Data structure objective questions.
2- Aptitude
3- Java / Node JS
4- Subjective programming Question
Subjective questions were
1- Print all interleavings of given two strings

2- Largest subarray with equal number of 0s and 1s

After the written round I went through 2 interviews.
First interviewer asked me 3 algorithm questions.
1- Segregate 0s and 1s in an array

2- Extended the above question to Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

3- There are 3 operation available.
     a) Subtract 1
     b) Divide by 2(applicable only when number is divisible by 2)
     c) Divide by 3(applicable only when number is divisible by 3)
Give the minimum number of operation requires to reduce the number to 1.
Second Interviewer asked only 1 question.
1- Recursively remove all adjacent duplicates in an array containing numbers.
Link to remove adjacent duplicates from string is mentioned below.
