I had Wipro Turbo coming to my college (College of Engineering,Trivandrum). Had one online test, one tech round and a HR round.
Online round was where most of the elimination took place.
Tech round(from the selected 29) 7 people got out and a couple in HR round.
Tech round started with few basic questions like tell me about yourself and questions connecting that.
Then he asked if I knew trees and related topics. I said yes, but not fluent with code so then he asked about linked list then he had me write the entire code to find the middle of a node in a circular linked list, the entire cpp code. Wrote it and he explained it.
Then he asked about memory leak, null pointers and garbage collection in C and Java.
HR round was pretty simple lasting just 5 mins asking question about my home place and related stuff. Asked if I was okay with relocation and things.
