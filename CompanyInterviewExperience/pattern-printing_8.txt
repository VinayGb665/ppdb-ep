Given a number as ‘num’, and Number of lines as ‘num_of_lines’ where ‘num’ implies the starting number from which the pattern has to be started and ‘num_of_lines’ implies the number of lines that have to be printed. Now, according to the above information, print a pattern as given below.
Examples:
Observations:
Approach:
So, start a loop from 0 to num_of_lines-1, to take care of the number of rows to be printed and another loop inside the first loop, from 0 till limit-1, the limit will be initialized to 1, and its value is increased exponentially. Now inside the loop, just increase the number by 1 to print the next number of that row.
