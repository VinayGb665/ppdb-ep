Given the value of n(n < 10), i.e, number of lines, print the Fibonacci triangle.
Examples:

The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..
In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation
with seed values F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
Below is the implementation of the above pattern :
