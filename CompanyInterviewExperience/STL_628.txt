Given two integer arrays of same size, “arr[]” and “index[]”, reorder elements in “arr[]” according to given index array. It is not allowed to given array arr’s length.
Example:
Expected time complexity O(n) and auxiliary space O(1)
We strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first.
A Simple Solution is to use an auxiliary  array temp[] of same size as given arrays.  Traverse the given array and put all elements at their correct place in temp[] using index[]. Finally copy temp[] to arr[] and set all values of index[i] as i.

Thanks to gccode for suggesting above solution.
We can solve it Without Auxiliary Array. Below is algorithm.
Below is implementation of above algorithm.

 Another Method  without using auxiliary array is to sort the arrays.
Sort the index array and customize the sort to swap the arr[] data whenever you swap the index[] data.

Output:
Time Compexity: O(nlogn)
