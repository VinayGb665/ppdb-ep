Given a number n, print least prime factors of all numbers from 1 to n. The least prime factor of an integer n is the smallest prime number that divides the number. The least prime factor of all even numbers is 2. A prime number is its own least prime factor (as well as its own greatest prime factor).
Note: We need to print 1 for 1.
Example :
We can use a variation of sieve of Eratosthenes to solve the above problem. 
Below is the implementation of the algorithm, where least_prime[] saves the value of the least prime factor corresponding to the respective index.

Exercise:
Can we extend this algorithm or use least_prime[] to find all the prime factors for numbers till n?
