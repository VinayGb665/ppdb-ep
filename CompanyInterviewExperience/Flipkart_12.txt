Round 0:

platform : HackerRank
3 questions :
1.A list of commands is given, you have to follow the commands and tell at which cell in matrix will u end up.
2. A schedule of meetings is given with some gaps in between . U have to shift only k meetings such that gap is maximized.
3. Find largest submatrix with sum <k.
Round 1:
1.tell us about urself.
2.A stream of numbers, at any point of time , return max n elements .
i used a minHeap
Then they modifies the question for a window . where i had to give them a LRU approach to delete elements out of the window.
3.Set next pointers of tree nodes.
Spent lot of time explaining the approach. They made me write the pseudo code.
I gave 2n space approach(2 queue)
then n space approach (1 queue)
(they didn’t ask me to further reduce space complexity)
Round 2:
1. Given array of characters with all characters repeating even times except for one. Find the one not repeating;
2. An infinite stream of characters is coming, at any point of time, you have to give the first non repeating character in 0(1) time.
Solution :
first i used min heap and hashmap and hash set but then we discussed and they helped me improve my solution and we settled on  2 arrays and a doubly linked list.
3.Asked me a puzzle
calculate 7/8 without using division or multiplication.
and then ceil of (7n/8) without division or multiplication.
4.then they asked me to print the tree :
2
1         3
4      5
print 1 4 5 3 2
print leaf, delete them and repeat kind. More like reverse of topological order
