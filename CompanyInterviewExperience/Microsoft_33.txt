Round 0: Coding Round
3 coding questions :
Platform cocubes (ui is very bad and be prepared to code in a very small text editor which can’t be enlarged).
1.Find average of ascii values of stream of characters (1 mark).
2.Evaluate a given infix expression consisting of numbers and operators.
3.Linked list question : insert the reversed liked list of nodes at odd position at alternate places.
1->2->3->4->5 to 1->5->2->3->4
(Other Questions were ){
2. regular expression matching
find how many substrings match that 10*1, exist in a given string.
3. Trim the BST so that it contains nodes with values within a given range only.
}

Round 1: Pen and Paper Round
2 questions were given and correct code was expected to be written.
1. Trains arrival and departure time was given and u have to calculate the max. platforms required so that no train has to wait.
2. Set the next pointer of all tree nodes.
(next pointer should point to node right to current node at same level).
Round 2: Technical Interview 1
.

Round 3:Technical Interview 2
1.Asked me to write a random() for hashmap to return a random key in 0(1) time .
He helped me through it and i talked about all the pros and cons of solution as we were constructing the solution.
2. Asked me to write code to construct Trie.
3. Asked me question about calculating Bandwidth of network as a application level programmer.
BW=data transmitted/time delay(he asked but i didn’t agree and i talked about all the delays and retransmission and stuff involved in time delay than he gave hint about files read/write )
so application point of view ::
time delay=file read/write time+propagation delay
so BW=data transmitted/propagation delay.
4. Gave me 25 horses problem to which i politely replied that i know it already.
5. Then he asked me how many matches will be there if every person is to have a match with every other.
ans : nc2.
6. How many matches if there are knockouts in a tournament.
ans : n/2+n/4+n/8+……+n/2^logn
Round 4: Technical Cum HM Interview
SUGGESTIONS :
1. Don’t spend too much time on writing code and being silent throughout . Write half the code, discuss your approach and its cons. They will spare the coding by having a look at even your half written code.
2. If u can’t fake that you have already done a question then straight ahead tell the interviewer.
3. Discuss things with the interviewer about your ideas and approach, they can’t help u if they don’t know where r u stuck . Also it gives them an impression that u can solve a problem with some other person or u can cooperate (team player).
