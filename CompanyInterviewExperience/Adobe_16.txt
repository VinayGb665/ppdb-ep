Online Aptitude Round
Online Aptitude Round consisted of 60 questions. I did about 40 questions with 90% accuracy.
Online Coding Round
Online Coding Round consisted of 2 questions related to arrays and strings (very easy).
One question was related to total number of palindromic strings.
For both questions, coding platform was CoCubes.
Those who did both the questions were called for the interview.
The interview day started with a written round.
WRITTEN ROUND
It consisted of 5 questions.
Something related to microprocessor (load, add etc)

–It can be done by bfs or dfs.
Given a hexadecimal number in the form of a string. Convert it into decimal string.

HR Round
Why Adobe?
What are your hobbies, strengths, and weaknesses?
How do u react in stressful situations? and some other usual questions.
After this, I got waitlisted and after 4 months I got a call for one more interview.
Technical Round
Reversing linked list (both iterative and recursive solutions)
Detailed discussion about all of my projects
Some puzzles
Oops concepts
I was asked to write a code explaining overloading and overriding.
I was asked to write a python code for searching a particular string in each line of a given file. 
I was asked, how many lines of code have I written in java, python and c++.
In how much time after 11 am, will both the minute and hour hand form an angle of 180 degree.
Some more questions on linked list.
Then the last round was HR Discussion.
After about 5 days, I got the email stating that I’d been selected.


SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR ADOBE
Prepare from geeksforgeeks thoroughly, especially c concepts and data structures.
They focus more towards your approach and the confidence with which you speak.
