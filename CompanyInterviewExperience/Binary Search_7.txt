Given a preorder traversal of a BST. The task is to find the number of elements less than root. 
Examples:
For a binary search tree, a preorder traversal is of the form:
root, { elements in left subtree of root }, { elements in right subtree of root }

Efficient approach (Using Binary Search): Here the idea is to make use of an extended form of binary search. The steps are as follows:
Below is the implementation of the above idea.
