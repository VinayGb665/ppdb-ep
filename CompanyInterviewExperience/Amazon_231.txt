Given an interval, the task is to count numbers which have same first and last digits.  For example, 1231 has same first and last digits. 
Examples:

Let us first consider below examples to understand the approach.
From above examples, we can observe that in each ten number span we have only one number which has the given property except 1 to 10 which has 9 numbers (all one digit number) having same starting and ending digit.
    Using above property we can solve given problem, first we break the given interval into two parts that is if interval is l to r, we break this into 1 to l and 1 to r, our answer is obtained by subtracting result of first query from second query.
Now we remain to find count of numbers with given property in range 1 to x, for this we divide x by 10, which gives number of 10-spans. We add 9 to the span for taking one digit numbers into account. If last digit of x is smaller than first digit of x, then 1 should be decreased in final answer to discard last ten span number because that number is out of range.
