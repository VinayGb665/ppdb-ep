Symantec Interview Experience Procedure
Round 1 – Online Test
The Online round was hosted by HackerRank. There was a total of 22 questions. The time given was 1 ½ hours. Every correct answer carried 1 mark and every wrong answer carried -1 mark.
Out of the 22 questions, 20 questions were MCQ which covered topics like C/C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, OS, aptitude, etc.
The other 2 questions were coding. The instructions specified that solving 1 would be enough. But the questions were very easy, so I did both since there was a lot of time left. One thing to note here is to take care of the time complexity of the solution. If it has bad time complexity, all of the 15 test cases might not pass.
Around 150 people took up the test in my college and around 60 people cleared the round. They were asked to come to the Symantec office in Chennai for the face to face interviews.
 Round 2 – Face to face interviews:
The interviews started at 10.30 am and went on till 6.00 pm. There was a break in between for 1 hour for lunch. Around 100-120 people had come for the interviews from various colleges.
Round 3
The 3rd round of the technical interview was not held for everyone. It was more like a 2nd chance for those people who did not do the 2nd round very well. I didn’t attend the 3rd round. They directly pushed me to the 4th round.
The 4th round was called Managerial round. It was like a HR round where they also asked puzzles other than the regular HR questions like “Why Symantec?”, “Are you placed already?”, etc.
In the end around 20 people were shortlisted for the internship. The results came out a few days later.
They provided lunch and snacks for all the candidates who attended the process. They showed around the entire office during the process of the interviews since each round took place in a different floor in the building.
Overall, it was a nice experience and the interviews were carried out smoothly by the Symantec team without any delays.
