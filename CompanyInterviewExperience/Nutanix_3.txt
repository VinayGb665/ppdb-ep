Debugging Round: This round also had 2 questions for 1:15 hrs. The questions contained logical errors which needed to be corrected.

The following two rounds followed the same pattern. There was one question in each round and all the students were simultaneously asked the same questions. After the interviewee answered the question, he/she was asked about their projects, or sometimes C/JAVA etc.
Round 1(F2F): 
Round 2(F2F):
Here also an O(N) solution was required.(consider using a stack).
5 of the students had answered the questions optimally in both the rounds. After the second round three guys were selected for HR round, While 2 of them had an extra round taken by all three interviewers combined, they were asked system design questions.
Round 3(HR): Usual HR stuff such as questions about resume, tell me about yourself, why this company, hobbies, future plans, choice of location, how do you deal with a non performing team member and so on.
 
The three selected guys were given a 6 month internship and FTE, and one of the guys from the extra round was offered only a 6 month internship.
