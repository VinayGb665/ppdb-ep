Round 3 (F2F with Dev Manager)
Q1. Connect nodes at same level in a binary tree( may not be a complete binary tree) without using recursion
Q2. Sort the linked list which contains only 1,2,3 numbers in a single pass
Round 4 (F2F with developers)
Q1. Design a snake and ladder game
Q2. Given a linked list contains even and odd numbers. separate the list into two lists contains odd/even numbers.

Challenging tasks done so far
Q1. Given a large file which contains m rows and n columns. Given a column no, sort the column in such a way that corresponding rows also sorted
Round 6 (F2F with Developers)
Q1. Print all pairs(sets) of prime numbers (p,q) such that p*q <= n, where n is given number
Q2. Given a binary tree, if parent is 0, then left child is 0 and right child is 1. if parent is 1, then left child is 1 and right child is 0. Root of the tree is 0. Find the kth node value which is present at Nth level
Q3. Longest monotonically increasing sequence in O(NlogN)
I couldn’t make it. Hope it helps someone else.
