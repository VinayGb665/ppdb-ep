Online Round:
It consisted of 20 mcqs and 2 coding questions. The test was hosted on HackerEarth.
Given a string. Find all the palindromic partitions of the string. (Number of way the string can be partitioned so that all the partitions are palindrome)
2. You are given with a large paragraph and N words.You have to find a min length subparagraph of the paragraph which contain all those N words in any order.
Round 1 (35-mins):
The interviewer started with the most common questions ‚ÄúTell me about yourself‚Äù , in which I explained my projects , my achievements and my strengths. I was asked 2 questions from ds and algo in this round.
Find all the hero and super hero in an array. Hero ‚Äì Elements which are greater than all the elements on its right side. Super Hero ‚Äì Elements which are greater than all the elements on its left and right side (Largest Element of the array which should only occur once). Expected Complexity ‚Äì O(1) space and O(n) time in single traversal.

Round 2 (60-mins):
I was asked to introduce myself asked about my strengths and my weakness. Like last round I was asked 2 questions on data structures and algorithms. 
Discussions on projects for 15-20 minutes.
Find Maximum number possible by doing at-most K adjacent swaps. Expected Time Complexity ‚Äì n*K and space complexity ‚Äì O(1) 
Find the closest pair to a given sum in an unsorted array. Approaches ‚Äì Brute force, Sorting , Ceil and floor using BST.
Memory Allocation in C++. How to allocate double memory in c++. Couldn‚Äôt Explain this.
Was called for 3rd round after 5 mins.
Round 3 (90-mins):
This round was purely on algorithm design and data structures.

Couldn‚Äôt derive this for O(1) space.

3. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-of-jumps-to-reach-end-of-a-given-array/
Explained O(n^2) dp approach. Gave a segment tree approach of time complexity O(nlogn) , space O(nlogn).
4. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-non-repeating-character-stream-characters/
Implemented using Double Linked List and Hashmap.
Was called for the final round after 5 mins.
Round 4 (30-mins):
The round started with discussions on Operating Systems and Compiler Design.
Operating System Questions-
What is caching ?
Where does cache lie in operating system ?
Difference between associative mapping and direct mapping in cache.
What is spooling ?
Applications of spooling.
Compiler Design Questions ‚Äì 
What is lexical analysis ?
What is semantic analysis ?
What is a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) ?
Difference between DFA and NFA ?
Exhaustive discussion on my current projects.
Finally 3 questions were asked on data structures and algorithms.
