Given a sorted array of n elements containing elements in range from 1 to n-1 i.e. one element occurs twice, the task is to find the repeating element in an array.
Examples :

A naive approach is to scan the whole array and check if an element occurs twice, then return. This approach takes O(n) time.
An efficient  method is to use Binary Search .
1- Check if the middle element is the repeating one.
2- If not then check if the middle element is at proper position if yes then start searching repeating element in right.
3- Otherwise the repeating one will be in left.
