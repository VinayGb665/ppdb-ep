BFS(Breadth First Search) is a graph traversal technique where a node and its neighbors are visited first and then the neighbors of neighbors. In simple terms it traverses level wise from the source. First it traverses level 1 nodes (direct neighbors of source node) and then level 2 nodes (neighbors of neighbors of source node) and so on.
Now, suppose if we have to know at which level all the nodes are at (from source node). Then BFS can be used to determine the level of each node.
