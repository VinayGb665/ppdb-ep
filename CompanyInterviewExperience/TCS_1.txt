Round 1: I applied in TCS through TCS National Qualifier Test .It is an online aptitude Test which tests for your quantitative aptitude, English(10 fill in the blanks) and coding(1 question). The Test has two sections :
The overall test is quite easy if in case you clear your standard test you will be called for the tcs ninja interview else for digital interview.
Suggestions:Test sites like Testpot, indiabix and geeksforgeeks  are really helpful in placement preparation for any company .Also material from prepInsta helped me a lot cracking this exam . Most of the questions that came were repeated so a good practice of previous year papers also helps .English is really the easiest part of this exam .so need not worry about it.The coding part is also easy .it asks for really easy programming questions like pallindrome, nth term in fibonacci series, series programs, string programs etc. But the time given for this section is only 20 minutes .so speed is an  important factor but never the less even if your program does not run you may get selected on the basis of your prformance in other sections.
 Round 2:once you have cleared your test you will get the result within a week .i had my test on  3 sep this year and got my result on 9 sept. and a interview call via mail for 12 sep .
There were three panelists one HR, 2 Technical i guess .questions asked to me were:
Questions asked by the HR :
Suggestions :Just  be confident its ok if you dont know the answer of few questions tell them you dont know.They are really supportive.I was able to answer most of my technical questions except a few .It was really good experience .And i got placed in it.
