I got a chance to participate in walk-in drive at Paytm Head quarters. Went through following process.
1) Written test: It contained 20 objective questions having a mix of C, networking and Database questions and 2 subjective questions.
Subjective questions: Stock buy sell maximum profit and Find sub string in a string
2) Tech round conducted by SE:
Ques 1: Reverse a given linked list 
Ques 2: Reverse linked list in group of size 3
Ques 3: Minimum distance between two given characters of a string
3) Tech round conducted by tech lead:
Ques 1: Tell me about yourself. Technology stack which you used while working.
Ques 2: Matrix multiplication (buy c++  book from Sumita Arora class XII level for answer :P)
Ques 3: Coin change problem (solved it using DP)
Interviewer was impressed with solution of coin change and later he discussed what were the most difficult data structure problems which I had solved. I told some like phone number keypad problem, sudoku solver etc.
I was only possible because of all the stuff I prepared regularly from geeksforgeeks which I could not have found anywhere else. Thanks to geeks for geeks. ðŸ™‚
