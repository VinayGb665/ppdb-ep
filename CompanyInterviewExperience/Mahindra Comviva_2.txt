Efficient solution for small ranged numbers.
1) Insert all elements of array in a hash table.
2) Find maximum element in the array.
3) For every array element, search multiples of it (till maximum) in the hash table. If found, increment result.
Different cases like negative numbers and repetitions can also be handled here with slight modifications to the approach.
