Given an array with distinct elements, the task is to find the pairs in the array such that a  % b = k, where k is a given integer.
Examples :

A Naive Solution is to make all pairs one by one and check their modulo is equal to k or not. If equals to k, then print that pair.

Time Complexity : O(n2)
An Efficient solution is based on below observations : 
To quickly check if an element is present in array, we use hashing.
