Codding round (90 min):
20 objectives from DS, OS, DBMS, Networking   and   2 coding questions:
 i. https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/dakshonline/challenges/yule-ball
 ii. https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/arrays/1-d/practice-problems/algorithm/i-demand-trial-by-combat-13/
ROUND I:
1. Given a binary string (e.g. 01, 101, 011), in each iteration 0 becomes 01 and 1 becomes 10, find kth character in the string after nth iteration
  simple approach, time complexity, express time complexity in terms of n only
  efficient approach, explanation, time complexity
2. Given n ropes of different lengths, connect them into one rope. cost to connect two ropes is equal to sum of their lengths. connect the ropes in minimum cost :

3. When and why merge sort is preferred over quicksort – time/space complexity
ROUND II:
1. Project discussion
2. Make binary tree symmetric – which all cases are possible, which traversal is used and why
3. Make half of the linked list reverse (iterative, recursive) and some questions from linked list
4. Recursion, data structure that is used in recursion
5. C++ string, overloading of + operator in string class
ROUND III:
1. Design a data structure to show most frequently purchased item to a customer, show items that are frequently purchased in a given time span
2. Priority_queue, map/unordered_map, sliding window concept
3. Search a given word in a dictionary (approach, time complexity, cost of insertion/deletion of new word in different data structures)
4. Binary search tree, AVL tree (Rotation, Insertion, Deletion), Trie data structure
5. Search a pattern in given string (Simple approach & Using KMP algorithm), handle all the cases
6. LRU Cache Implementation
ROUND IV:
1. Introduce Yourself
2. Project discussion
3. Convert a given Integer to its corresponding Roman numeral
4. Hamiltonian cycle & few graph questions (Cycle in directed/undirected graph)
In between they asked some questions from OS, DBMS, Networking:
  – Belady’s Anomaly, Context Switching, Conflict Serializability, Functions of some OSI-layers etc..
