Given a list of words, find if any of the two words can be joined to form a palindrome.
Examples:
Asked in : Google Interview
Simple approach:
Run on IDE
Run on IDE

Time Complexity : O(n2k)
Here n is the number of the words in the list and k is the maximum length that is checked for a palindrome.
Â 
Efficient method
It can be done in an efficient manner by using the Trie data structure. The idea is to maintain a Trie of the reverse of all words.
