Find the n’th  term in Look-and-say (Or Count and Say) Sequence.  The look-and-say sequence is the sequence of below integers:
1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221, 312211, 13112221, 1113213211, … 
How is above sequence generated?
n’th term in generated by reading (n-1)’th term.
How to find n’th term?
Example:
The idea is simple, we generate all terms from 1 to n.  First two terms are initialized as “1” and “11”,  and all other terms are generated using previous terms.  To generate a term using previous term, we scan the previous term.  While scanning a term, we simply keep track of count of all consecutive characters. For sequence of same characters, we append the count followed by character to generate the next term.
Below is implementation of above idea.
