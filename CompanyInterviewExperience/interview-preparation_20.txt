This is a model placement paper for aptitude preparation of Cognizant Technology Solutions Interview. This placement paper will cover aptitude questions that are asked in CTS recruitment drives and also strictly follows the pattern of questions asked in CTS interviews. It is recommended to solve each one of the following questions to increase your chances of clearing the CTS interview.
Solution:
Since the cube is melted so the volume of the new cube must be the same.
Volume of new cube = Volume of cube 1 + cube 2 + cube 3 = 63 + 83 + 103 = 216 + 512 + 1000
a^3 = 1728,
a = (1728)^(1/3) = 12
Solution:
We know that
Price * Consumption = Expenditure
and, Consumption = Expenditure Price
So,
(15 / 8x) – (15 / x) = 12
x = (15 * 2) / (12 * 8)
For 16 Mangoes = [(15 * 2) / (12 * 8)] * 16 = 5 (answer)
Solution:
According to the question,
((1/2)x)/21 + ((1/2)x)/24 = 10
Solving this equation we get 15x = 168 * 20
Further x = (168 * 20)/15 = 224 km.
Solution:
This can be found by finding the LCM of 48 and 50.
They will ring together after,
LCM of 48 and 50 secs.
48 = 2*2*2*2*3;
50 = 2*5*5;
So, LCM = 2*2*2*2*3*5*5 = 1200 secs = 20 min.
Therefore, they will beep together at 12:20 PM next.
Solution:
Let’s find the cost price of 1 toy = 375 / 12 = 31.25 rupees.
Now, SP of 1 toy = 33 rupees.
So, Gain = SP – CP = (33 – 31.25) = Rs. 1.75
and Profit % = 1.75 / 31.25 * 100 = 5.6 %
Solution:
So according to the question,
1/4 th of the cistern can be filled in one hour
1/9 th of the cistern can be emptied in 1 hour
Therfore, net filled in 1 hour = 1/4 – 1/9 = 5/36
So cistern that can be filled in 36/5 hours = 7.2 hours

Solution:
There are 6 letters in the word and no letters are repeated.
So, the 6 letters can be arranged in 6! ways = 720 ways.
Solution:
Total number of handshakes = 12 * 12 = 144
Solution: 
We need to find the LCM of the given numbers,
LCM of 21, 27, 33, and 55 = 10395
So we need to add an extra 5 = 10403 (answer)
Solution:
Since there are 8 teams, so each pair will pay a match = 8C2 = 28 matches.
