I applied for DE Shaw off campus through their site.
Round 1 (Online round):
After a few weeks, a hackerrankÂ link was provided for an online coding round. The coding round consisted of two questions, both of them were of medium difficulty. But implementing both of them in just 1 hour was quite an impossible task. I could not solve any of them fully, but made sure a decent number of test cases got passed in each one of them.
Round 2 (Code pair):
Probably the trick worked and I got a mail for a code pair round on hackerrank. The following questions were asked:
I answered each one of them correctly and was informed of getting into the next round.
Round 3 (On-site):
Around 10-12 people were flown from their respective cities to their Hyderabad office. We were made to fill up some forms regarding basic details, and then I was the first one to be interviewed among all. A team of 2 people were present to take the interview for each of the on-site rounds. Following questions were asked:
Round 4 (On-site):
After the first round was over, only 4 people were called in for the second round. The rest were kept waiting. Questions asked in this round were:
Further rounds (On-site):
For me, no further rounds were taken after this, even though I believed all my rounds went very well. I got disheartened because there were people whose 2 more rounds had taken place (one HR round and one technical), while I just kept waiting like the rest.
Then, we all came back to our respective homes and after 2 days, I got a call from DE Shaw that I had been selected! ðŸ˜€
