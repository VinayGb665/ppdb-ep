I had SAP Labs first round on 10th Oct 2015(ON-CAMPUS).
The first round consisted of 15 logical reasoning numerical questions which were bit tough i felt as  i never practiced apti (mainly consisted of relationships qns, people sitting around a round table who is beside whom(some thing of this kind qns 5-6).
One passage on RISING PRICES INFLATION .
10 Questions on picture viewing , like
1. given 3 bags picture, select the one which best suites a girl/lady for regular use ,
2. What is hidden in BASKIN ROBINS symbol(they will display symbol also) ans: a number 13
3. what can u see in KINGFISHER symbol etc…
4 questions on Software engineering(qns on water fall model , black box testing) and one testing question
(i got it on quick sort).
Finally had two coding questions
1. Given {“hello”,”aaa”,”hi”} dispaly 1 if reverse of a string exists in the input else 0.
ans: here reverse(“hello”)=”olleh” which is not in input , so display 0
similarly for “aaa” , u should display 1.
2.i dont remember the question , but logic was easy. given 4 as input find its factorial i.e, soln=16
now do soln = soln – 1;
finally display soln*soln;
The people who solved more than 1 and a half codes got shortlisted for developer interview and the people
 who solved less than 1 code got shortlisted for consultancy.
Note:The have their own compiler, so dont worry about complexity just solve it.
