This is my interview experience for DE Shaw India. They visited NIT Wrangell for the placement year 2017-18 . 
First round, this was an online round  with technical and some general  apti and 2 coding questions. Aptitude questions where mainly from OS, Networks, OOP concept etc. coding qn : 1 was based on sorting and other was based on dynamic programming. Around 15 students were selected from this round .
Two technical interview rounds : these rounds included a lot of programming as well as theoretical questions . programming questions where mostly from dp, array and graphs where as theoretical questions spanned across OS, networks, oops, dbms . Also there was a discussion on my projects . A lot of programming questions where asked and interview went for quite a long time . Most of the people who cleared 1st round appeared for both the interviews .
1 HR round : a stress free round with just general questions being asked. 
I highly followed geeksforgeeks for my interview preparation and it helped a lot .
