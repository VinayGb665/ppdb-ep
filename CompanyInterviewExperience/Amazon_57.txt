Telephonic round:

Round 1:
You have two lane road and there are two sensors,
Input of the function is two arrays filled with 24 hours of data and value/item of array is tuple having direction and time. find following things,
Finding no 1 is easy.
Only issue is with 2,3 as we don’t have any unit of distance given anywhere. I asked him he told that’s a problem ?
This what we can do without distance we can at-least find the minimum and maximum time for sensor A and B just traversing an array but after that finding a distance that’s still a mystery to me ? in last few minutes he told me take a guess and do it but no enough time.
Round 2:
Build an UBER platform no code discussion about how will you do it,
Round 3:
Build Eclipse IDE. Told me to write down class diagram of all components.
Round 4:

No offer by the way.
In SDE-I two designing questions. I didn’t expected that. Even though i have done some designing over past 2 years but never attempted problem as big as an IDE.
Hope this helps and PEACE.
