coding round 1–(1 hr) – hackrrank
1. given a string of any length, check if first half of the string (n/2+1 in case of odd length) is an anagram of the second half of the string or not. 
2.in a 2d matrix, some cells are obstacles and others are clear. find number of paths from 0,0 to m,n.(0 paths if 0,0 is obstacle, wasn’t specified but was the 6th test case).
coding round 2— (45 min + 15 min extended later) – hackrrank
1. given n cities’ populations. you have to divide k hospitals in these cities such that the population load for the hospital with maximum load is minimum eg 2 cities – 20000,50000 and k=6 . so hospital in 1st=2, in 2nd=4 and answer is 12,500, the maximum load on any hospital.
–add populations to priority queue, assume giving one hospital to each city in starting. pop from queue, give this city one more hospital, add (population)/(no. of hospitals to queue), do this till you have hospitals left, then return top of priority queue.
2. simple bfs question with surprisingly complex language.. couldn’t figure out the question.. something about rods fused together being seperated where cost of each seperation is sqrt(no. o
