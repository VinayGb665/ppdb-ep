What is Vector of Tuple?
A tuple is an object that can hold a number of elements and a vector containing multiple number of such tuple is called a vector of tuple. The elements can be of different data types. The elements of tuples are initialized as arguments in order in which they will be accessed.

Different ways to sort vector of tuples
Case 1 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of first element of tuples in ascending order.
This type of sorting can be achieved using simple “ sort() ” function. By default the sort function sorts the vector elements on basis of first element of tuples.

Case 2 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of second element of tuples in ascending order.
There are instances when we require to sort the elements of vector on the basis of second elements of tuples. For that, we modify the sort() function and we pass a third argument, a call to an user defined explicit function in the sort() function.

Case 3 : Sorting the vector elements on the basis of third element of tuples in ascending order.
There are instances when we require to sort the elements of vector on the basis of third elements of tuples. For that, we modify the sort() function and we pass a third argument, a call to an user defined explicit function in the sort() function.
