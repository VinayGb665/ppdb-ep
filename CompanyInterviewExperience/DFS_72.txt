Given a directed graph, a source vertex ‘s’ and a destination vertex ‘d’, print all paths from given ‘s’ to ‘d’. 
Consider the following directed graph.  Let the s be 2 and d be 3.  There are 4 different paths from 2 to 3.

The idea is to do Depth First Traversal of given directed graph.  Start the traversal from source.  Keep storing the visited vertices in an array say ‘path[]’.  If we reach the destination vertex, print contents of path[]. The important thing is to mark current vertices in path[] as visited also, so that the traversal doesn’t go in a cycle. 
Following is implementation of above idea.
