It was conducted on Cocubes. It consisted of 3 questions:
2 marks:Average of ascii characters of string.
Input:abc
Output:(65+66+67)/3=66
3 marks:Reverse k nodes at a time in a linked list.
5 marks:Cousin sum in a binary tree.
Other questions were:
1.Infix evaluation
2.Given an array of numbers, find the smallest number after n deletions
3.Next palindrome.
Of 200 students about 60 were selected for next pen and paper round.We had one ds question detect and remove loop from a linked list and 6 short questions based on C.
At the end of each round I was asked the question “Do you have any question for me?”.
Round 1(F2F):
First I had to explain my approach, then write the entire code and test cases for each problem.
1.Reverse a sentence.
Input:”This is a test”
Output:”test a is This”
2.Reverse the sentence preserving whitespaces.
Input:”This is   a    test”
Output:”test a   is    This”
3.Identify whether given nodes of a binary tree are directly connected or not.

Input    Output
2        true
5,4      false
5,4,9    true
Round 2(F2F):
1.There are two types of characters one of 1 byte and another of 2 bytes, I had to delete the last character.
2.Design a remote just like  keypad of old phones, and display all corresponding channels on TV screen.
Input:22227723
Output:
a
b
c
a
ap
aq
aqa
aqd
Round 3:
First I was asked “Tell me about yourself.”
then “What I wanted to do in life?” and 2 coding questions, just logic no implementation.
1.Popultate right pointer in a binary tree.
2.Given a file print all the anagrams together.
Finally, I was selected.It was one of the best moments of my life.
