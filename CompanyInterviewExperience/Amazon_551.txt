Amazon visited our campus, these are the questions that I faced.
Online Round (90 minutes)
20 MCQs(Data structure, C, C++, OS, Probability ).
2 programs :
1. Given an array of integers. Segregate all the non-zero numbers at the beginning. Print the number of non-zero integers and the minimum number of swaps required for these operations.
Eg. : I/p : 1, 0, 0, -6, 2, 0
o/p : Number of non-zero integers : 3
Minimum number of swaps : 2
2. Given a text txt[0..n-1] and a pattern pat[0..m-1], write a function search(char pat[], char txt[]) that prints all occurrences of pat[] and its permutations (or anagrams) in txt[]. You may assume that n > m.
E.g. : I/p : txt[] = “BACDGABCDA” pat[] = “ABCD”
o/p :0,5,6
1st PI
2nd PI
I/p : Meeting I – 8:30 – 12:50
Meeting II – 10:15 – 11:30
Meeting III – 11:45 – 1:30
O/p : 2
3rd PI
4th PI
Fortunately, I was selected as an FTE in Amazon.
Suggestions
I would like to give a few suggestions to all the upcoming candidates :-
A very best of luck to all of you for your upcoming interviews.
