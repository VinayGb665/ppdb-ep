The task is pretty simple as we can get the maximum value on multiplying all values but the point is to handle the case of 0 and 1 i.e. On multiplying with 0 and 1 we get the lower value as compared to on adding with 0 and 1.
So, use ‘*’ sign between any two numbers(except numbers containing 0 and 1) and use ‘+’ if any of the number is 0 and 1.
