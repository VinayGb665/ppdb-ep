Given a Binary Tree, check whether the Binary tree contains a duplicate sub-tree of size 2 or more.
Note : Two same leaf nodes are not considered as subtree size of a leaf node is one.

Tree with duplicate Sub-Tree [ highlight by blue color ellipse ]
[ Method 1]
A simple solution is that, we pick every node of tree and try to find is any sub-tree of given tree is present in tree which is identical with that sub-tree. Here we can use below post to find if a subtree is present anywhere else in tree.
Check if a binary tree is subtree of another binary tree 
[Method 2 ]( Efficient solution )
An Efficient solution based on tree serialization and hashing.  The idea is to serialize subtrees as strings and store the strings in hash table.  Once we find a serialized tree (which is not a leaf) already existing in hash-table, we return true.
Below c++ implementation of above idea.
