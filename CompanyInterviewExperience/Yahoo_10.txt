Given a value n, find out the largest palindrome number which is product of two n digit numbers.
Examples :
Below are steps to find the required number.
1) Find a lower limit on n digit numbers. For example, for n = 2, lower_limit is 10.
2) Find an upper limit on n digit numbers. For example, for n = 2, upper_limit is 99.
3) Consider all pairs of numbers where ever number lies in range [lower_limit, upper_limit]
Below is the implementation of above steps.
