Given a directed graph, a source vertex ‘src’ and a destination vertex ‘dst’, print all paths from given ‘src’ to ‘dst’.
Consider the following directed graph. Let the src be 2 and dst be 3. There are 3 different paths from 2 to 3.

We have already discussed Print all paths from a given source to a destination using DFS.
Below is BFS based solution.
