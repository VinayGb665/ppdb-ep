Given an array of integers and a sum, the task is to print all subsets of given array with sum equal to given sum.

This problem is mainly an extension of Subset Sum Problem. Here we not only need to find if there is a subset with given sum, but also need to print all subsets with given sum.
Like previous post, we build a 2D array dp[][] such that dp[i][j] stores true if sum j is possible with array elements from 0 to i.
After filling dp[][], we recursively traverse it from dp[n-1][sum]. For cell being traversed, we store path before reaching it and consider two possibilities for the element.
1) Element is included in current path.
2) Element is not included in current path.
Whenever sum becomes 0, we stop the recursive calls and print current path.
Below is implementation of above idea.
