Round 1 : Telephone + Codepair on Hackerrank
Coding question
Given an array, delete elements of array one by one. If you delete ‘n’, you will delete all occurrences of ‘n’ and you will score points equal to n*(frequency of n in array). Now after this operation, you have to delete all occurrences of (n-1) and (n+1) and score no points. Again choose a new element and repeat the process until array is empty.
