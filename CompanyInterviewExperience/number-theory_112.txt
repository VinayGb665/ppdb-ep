Fermat’s little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a p – a is an integer multiple of p. 

Here p is a prime number
ap ≡ a (mod p).
Special Case: If a is not divisible by p, Fermat’s little theorem is equivalent to the statement that a  p-1-1 is an integer multiple of p.
                     ap-1 ≡ 1 (mod p)
                                     OR
                      an-1  % p = 1
Here a is not divisible by p. 

Take an Example How Fermat’s little theorem works
Examples:
Use of Fermat’s little theorem
If we know m is prime, then we can also use Fermats’s little theorem to find the inverse.
am-1 ≡ 1 (mod m)
If we multiply both sides with a-1, we get
 a-1 ≡ a m-2 (mod m)
