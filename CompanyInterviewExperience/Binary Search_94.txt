An Efficient solution of this problem is to use binary search.
1. For first occurrence of a number  
2. For last occurrence of a number

Time Complexity : O(log n)
Auxiliary Space :  O(1) if we use iterative Binary Search is used (Readers can refer Binary Search article for iterative Binary Search)
