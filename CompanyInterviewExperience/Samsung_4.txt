There are N fishing spots and 3 gates. At each gate there are some fishermen waiting to reach the nearest unoccupied fishing spot. (Total no of fisherman <=N)
Distance between consecutive spots = distance between gate and nearest spot = 1 m
Only 1 gate can be opened at a time and all fishermen of that gate must occupy the spots before the next gate is opened.
Distance is calculated as gate to nearest spot + nearest spot to closest vacant spot.
Find the total sum of minimum distances need to walk for all the fishermen.
Inputs to be taken:
Number of fishing spots
Position of the gates
Number of fishermen at each gates 
Follow this example:

Total number of fishing spots= 10
5 fisherman at gate 1 located at position 4,
2 fishermen at gate 2 located at position 6,
2 fishermen at gate 3 located at position 10,
If gates are opened in order G1->G2->G3
The arrangement will be:

Distance is calculated as gate to nearest spot + nearest spot to closest vacant spot.
After G1 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 1.
Distance = 11m
After G2 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 2.
Distance = 5m
After G3 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 3.
Distance = 3m
Total distance in this order : 11 + 5 + 3 = 19
If gates are opened in order G2->G1->G3
Case1 – Last fisherman of gate 2 is placed at position 7
the final arrangement will be:

After G2 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 2.
Distance = 3m
After G1 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 1.
Distance = 12m
After G3 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 3.
Distance = 3m
Total distance in this order : 3+12+3 = 18
Case2 – Last fisherman of gate 2 is placed at position 5
the final arrangement will be:

After G2 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 2.
Distance = 3m
After G1 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 1.
Distance = 14m
After G3 gate is opened, fishermen are placed at spots marked with 3.
Distance = 3m
Total distance in this order : 3+14+3 = 20
Other cases are redundant
so minimum distance is 18 
Solution:
Generate all combinations and assigns fishermen in all gate combinations to calculate minimum walking distance.
Generating combination can be done in both recursive and iterative way. Now to eliminate unnecessary permutations we can conclude that, for minimum walking distances, fishermen from a particular gate must stay together i.e they should occupy consecutive fishing spots. Thus we can visualise the problem as 3 blocks(group of fisherman) sliding through the entire fishing range. The minimum of which is the answer.
