The set::upper_bound() is a built-in function in C++ STL which returns an iterator pointing to the immediate next element which is just greater than k. If the key passed in the parameter exceeds the maximum key in the container, then the iterator returned points to the last element in the set container. 
Syntax:
Parameters: This function accepts a single mandatory parameter key which specifies the element whose upper bound is to be returned.
Return Value: The function returns an iterator pointing to the immediate next element which is just greater than k. If the key passed in the parameter exceeds the maximum key in the container, then the iterator points to the last element in the set container.
