I was interviewed for customer returns team for Hyderabad campus. I had 1 year and 9 month experience at the time of getting interviewed. Less experience was something which was worrying me a lot. They generally ask for 3-5 years of experience, but come down to 2 years if you are good.
1. What is so special about typescript that both Angular and React included it in the recent versions. Tsc compiler, final output, difference between java, JS and TS were discussed. Any live project use case where TS helped more than JS (I come from a pure JS background that’s why this question was asked)
2. Design a vending machine with following functionalities
Both HLD and LLD were expected.
Round 2 to 6 were done in Amazon Hyderabad campus. All interviews were back to back. It started from 11 AM to 5:30 PM with just half an hour lunch break. Before I could even step out after completing one round, other interviewers would already be waiting outside. Interviewers were very helping, but only if your are thinking in the right direction. HR also was very supportive. He was coming and motivating me after every round. Some advices here
