Platform Used – AMCAT
Round 1:
CTS came in our campus this year and the hiring as we all knew has slowed down, thus there was competition and trust me when I tell you this, that only if you prepare well then only you can clear the test specially the Coding Round. Lucky for me I was told by my seniors that will recruit via AMCAT and I was told by most of our friends that Questions from PrepInsta repeat in AMCAT. Around 40% of the paper was same, so I was able to solve the question.
These were the following sections asked in the Paper
Trust me this section is tough and you must prepare for them some previous questions asked in coding are easily searchable in google.
Round 2:
There was no 2nd round directly after first round there was HR Round.
Round 3: 
It was a basic HR Round.
Asking General Questions like Where do you see yourself after 5 years, why do you want to join CTS etc.
