Given a list of word lists  How to print all sentences possible taking one word from a list at a time via recursion? 
Example: 
We strongly recommend to minimize your browser and try this yourself first.
The idea is based on simple depth first traversal.  We start from every word of first list as first word of an output sentence, then recur for the remaining lists.
Below is C++ implementation of above idea. In the below implementation, input list of list is considered as a 2D array.  If we take a closer look, we can observe that the code is very close to DFS of graph.
