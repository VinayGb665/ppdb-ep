The set::emplace_hint() is a built-in function in C++ STL which inserts a new element in the set. A position is passed in the parameter of the function which acts as a hint from where the searching operation starts before inserting the element at its current position. The position only helps the process to get faster, it does not decide where the new element is to be inserted. The new element is inserted following the property of the set container only. 
Syntax:
Parameters: The function accepts two mandatory parameters which are described below: 
Return Value: The function returns an iterator pointing to the position where the insertion is done. If the element passed in the parameter already exists, then it returns an iterator pointing to the position where the existing element is. 
Below program illustrates the above function.
