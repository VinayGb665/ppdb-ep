Given a and b, find the ceiling value of a/b without using ceiling function. 
Examples:
The problem can be solved using ceiling function, but the ceiling function does not work when integers are passed as parameters. Hence there are following 2 approaches below to find the ceiling value. 
Approach 1: 
ceilVal = (a / b) + ((a % b) != 0) 
a/b returns the integer division value, and ((a % b) != 0) is a checking condition which returns 1 if we have any remainder left after the division of a/b, else it returns 0. The integer division value is added with the checking value to get the ceiling value.   
Given below is the illustration of the above approach:

# Python3 program to find ceil(a/b)
# without using ceil() function
import math
# Driver Code
# taking input 1
a = 4;
b = 3;
val = (a / b) + ((a % b) != 0);
print(“The ceiling value of 4/3 is”,
                   math.floor(val));
# example of perfect division
# taking input 2
a = 6;
b = 3;
val = int((a / b) + ((a % b) != 0));
print(“The ceiling value of 6/3 is”, val);

Approach 2:  
ceilVal = (a+b-1) / b 
Using simple maths, we can add the denominator to the numerator and subtract 1 from it and then divide it by denominator to get the ceiling value.
