I got a call from a consulting firm regarding this opening. 
Round 1: Hackerank Online test:(1.5 hours)  It had two questions. you have to pass all the test cases.
Round 2: Coderpad round :(1 hour) Usually has two questions. but depending on the time they may or may not ask the second one. you should complete atleast one with an optimal solution.
I could give only brute force solution of this question and the interview process ended here. Wishing others all the best for their experience here.
