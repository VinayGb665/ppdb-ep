I find GeeksforGeeks very helpful! It helped me prepare for my FactSet interview. Hereâ€™s my interview experience for FactSet which came to my college for recruitment.
Round 1 (Written Coding) : 
3 coding questions.
-printing the boundary elements of binary elements
-finding the smallest square submatrix out of a given square matrix whose sum is  equal to given sum
-finding a subsequence of given size whose sum is equal to given sum
Round 2 (technical interview):
2 interviewers were there and the interview went on for about 30 minutes. Questions they asked were-
-designing a stack which performs the getmin() function in O(1) time without using  any extra space
-finding the median of two sorted arrays of same size
-how did you solve the submatrix problem of Round 1
Round 3(technical interview):
2 interviewers and 30 minute duration.
-checking if a number is power of 2 using only bit-wise operators
-finding the intersection point of two linked lists
-finding the product of all the elements of the array except for the current element
Round 4(HR interview):
the interview went for about 30 minutes. The questions asked were-
-your strengths
-a puzzle: if a rectangular paper is given, how many ways are there to divide it  equally in 2 parts
-another puzzle: if a rectangular section is cut from the rectangle, how many  ways are there to divide it equally in 2 parts such that section gets divided  equally too.
-another puzzle: if 9 identical items are given of which 1 is heavy, how many  minimum numbers of comparisons you need to find the
