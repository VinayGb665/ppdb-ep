ZoomCar Interview experience:
Few weeks ago, I got a mail from Zoomcar HR saying that the CTO of the company wanted to have In-person interview with me.I was a  bit shocked and confused, Since Zoomcar is now mid-size startup ,having a tech-team of  50+ people.But since the CTO directly called me for the  interview so I decided to go and visit him. 
First Round with CTO 
Duration : 1 hour 30 min
Second Round with Technical Lead
Duration : 1 hour
TL entered into the conference room and went through my resume .
Finally, CTO entered the conference room and asked me about my expectation, since I hadnâ€™t prepared my mind to go and crack the interview, so I roughly gave them one BIG number, next day I got a call from HR saying that they are ready to hire me  for the same.
BOOM!
IBIBO Interview experience :
All interviews were taken by Tech Head of the product team.
First Round :
Second Round :
Third Round :
Fourth Round : 
Build a Rails app for authentication of users which consumes Rest api and oauth2 implementation. There were some other constraints also in terms of UI like page should refresh and UI should be attractive  etc.
After being interviewed and getting feedbacks from HR of  both the companies, I was bit confused whether I should go for these companies or I should work for growing startup , So I had a talk with my founder over drinks that I really wanted to groom myself as an entrepreneur , but if i join any of them , I will grow as a developer.
So my founder gave me an opportunity to groom as co-founder and lead in tech, Operations and represent the company to investors for fund raising. 
So I recommend all the students that you should invest early stage of your career working amongst passionate people in a small companies  where you will be have more responsibilities and you will be able to  prove yourself that will help you in grooming more compare to other big tech companies.
