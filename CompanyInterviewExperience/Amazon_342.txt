Find the number of negative numbers in a column-wise / row-wise sorted matrix M[][]. Suppose M has n rows and m columns.
Example:
We strongly recommend you to minimize your browser and try this yourself first.
Naive Solution
Here’s a naive, non-optimal solution.
We start from the top left corner and count the number of negative numbers one by one, from left to right and top to bottom.
With the given example:
Below is the implementation of above idea.

Output  : 
In this approach we are traversing through the all the elements and therefore, in the worst case scenario (when all numbers are negative in the matrix), this takes O(n * m) time.
 
Optimal Solution
Here’s a more efficient solution:

Run on IDE
Output  : 
With this solution, we can now solve this problem in O(n + m) time.
