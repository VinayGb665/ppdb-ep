Recently Amazon visited our college for hiring 2 months summer interns.
Round 1: It was Online round on HackerEarth consisting of 20 technical questions and 2 Coding questions.

Round 2:
After Online Round 40 students were selected for Interview. And there were only 2 technical Interviews.
In my First Interview Round Interviewer asked me followings:
But the string is not stored in Normal Character Array. Here each character is a node in Linked List (includingÂ  Â space too).
Then he asked me about LRU Cache. and asked about How it is Implemented. i was not able to answer quite correctly but somehow i came up with Linked List approach.
This round lasted about 45 minutes.I was asked to write code on Paper. The Interviewer was quite helpful.
Round 3: Guys who did good in 1st interview were called for 2nd interview.
The interviewer asked me what questions i was asked in 1st round.
And this Interview also lasted about 40 Minutes. And Finally 15Â students were Selected and Luckily I was One ofÂ  Â  Â  Â  them ðŸ™‚
last thing i would like to say is Be Confident.
