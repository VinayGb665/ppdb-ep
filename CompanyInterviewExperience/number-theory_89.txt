Given an integer n, we need to find the number of positive integers whose factorial ends with n zeros.
Examples:
 
Prerequisite : Trailing zeros in factorial.
Naive approach:We can just iterate through the range of integers and find the number of trailing zeros of all the numbers and print the numbers with n  trailing zeros.
Efficient Approach:In this approach we use binary search. Use binary search for all the numbers in the range and get the first number with n trailing zeros. Find all the numbers with m trailing zeros after that number.
