Recently Arista Networks visited our campus for hiring interns and full timers.
Minimum CGPA required was 8.5.There were a total of 3 rounds.
Round 1 : Online coding round conducted on Hacker Rank(1.5 hours)
There were 4 coding questions and 5 MCQ’s to be solved in 90 minutes.
Q1 Remove adjacent elements from circular linked list if they are same. 
     Tricky part was that the last element is adjacent to first element in Circular Linked List
(Difficulty- Easy)
Q2 Print n’th (n<=20000) fibonacci number in hexadecimal form.
    eg- Input –  8
         Output – 15 since 8th fibonacci no is 21 it's hexadecimal is 15
      Had to use string addition and divison for solving it.
  (Difficulty-Medium)
Q3 Given a string and numbers decrypt it and find pattern for encrypting other strings.
  Pattern was like 158-a 157-b …. 133-z
Given – heab (151 154 158 157)
just observe the pattern 
Input – abc
Output- 158 157 156
(Difficulty- Easy)
Q4 It was based on DFS and we were supposed to do topological sort.
Tricky part was to think that the question was to find topological sort.
(Difficulty-Medium)
MCQ's were based on C (pointers,dynamic memory allocation,etc)
Round 2 : FTF Technical Round (45 minutes)
1 Discussion on the questions solved and not solved in online coding round.
2 Asked about pointers and dynamic memory allocation in C.
3 Implement LRU Cache(Used queue)
4 Implement Web Crawler(Gave him a DFS based approach)
5 Asked about OOP’s concepts.
6 Given 6 digit no find duplicates in O(n) time and minimum space(He wanted an approach based on bit array).
7 Different types of scheduling algorithms in OS
8 How to implement a dynamic array(vector) in C
9 Memory layout of program(Stack Heap and other sections)

Round 3 : FTF Techinal and HR Round (30 minutes)
1 Print elements of BST in sorted order.(Inorder traversal)
2 Print vertical traversal of binary tree(Both recursive and iterative)
3 Store phone no in phone directory such that you can retrieve information based on phone numbers
4 Maintain k most frequently dialed numbers in a phone
5 Question based on trie trees
6 Given an array of numbers find no of subarrays that begin with 3 and end with 6
7 Display all running process in linux (use top command)
8 Difference between zombie and orphan process
9 Why do you want to join Arista??
Thanks GFG for being a perfect platform for practice.
