Given an array of N integers. You are allowed to rearrange the element of the array. The task is to find the maximum value of Σarr[i]*i, where i = 0, 1, 2,…., n – 1.
Examples:

A simple solution is to generate all permutations of given array. For every permutation, compute the value of Σarr[i]*i and finally return the maximum value.
An efficient solution is based on the fact that the largest value should be scaled maximum and smallest value should be scaled minimum. So we multiply minimum value of i with minimum value of arr[i]. So, sort the given array in increasing order and compute the sum of ari]*i, where i = 0 to n-1.
Below is the implementation of this approach:
