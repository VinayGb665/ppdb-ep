Round 1 (Telephonic)
1) What is LRU. How to Implement it.
2) Find kth smallest element in an array.
3) In a file, there are two columns, first column has some word (String) and 2nd column has some value (Double).
Example :-
ABC 23.4
ERF 34.89
WERT 122.9
Now user wants some arithmetic operations like
1) ABC + ERF = 23.4 + 34.89 = 58.29
2) ABC – WERT = 23.4 – 122.9 = -99.5
Design an efficient DS for these kind of operations.
Round 2 (F2F)
1) Asked about current Project.
2) Given a string str. You have to make this string to square string with maximum length. A square string is of the following format:
str = x + x; where x is any string. Return length of this square string.
Example
str = ababa
Max length square string = 4;
str = abcd
Max length square string = 1;
Round 3 (F2F)
1) Asked about current project. Asked to draw architecture of my project. Then Asked to design a new feature that is currently not there in my project.
2) Design undo and redo operation in Microsoft Word like text editor.
3) Design Hit Counter. (Design Hit Counter)
Round 4 (F2F)
1) Asked about current project.
2) You are given a text file. You have to return the list of starting index of the given word in text file. Design an efficient DS for that.
Example :-
Text file content : “geeks for geeks”
word : “geeks”
List : {0,10}
