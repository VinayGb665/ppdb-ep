Lists are sequence containers that allow non-contiguous memory allocation. As compared to vector, list has slow traversal, but once a position has been found, insertion and deletion are quick. Normally, when we say a List, we talk about doubly linked list. For implementing a singly linked list, we use forward list.
 
Functions used with List :
front() – Returns the value of the first element in the list
back() – Returns the value of the last element in the list
push_front(g) – Adds a new element ‘g’ at the beginning of the list
push_back(g) – Adds a new element ‘g’ at the end of the list
pop_front() – Removes the first element of the list, and reduces size of the list by 1
pop_back() – Removes the last element of the list, and reduces size of the list by 1
begin() – Returns an iterator pointing to the first element of the list
end() – Returns an iterator pointing to the theoretical last element which follows the last element
empty() – Returns whether the list is empty(1) or not(0)
insert() – Inserts new elements in the list before the element at a specified position
erase() – Removes a single element or a range of elements from the list
assign() – Assigns new elements to list by replacing current elements and resizes the list
remove() – Removes all the elements from the list, which are equal to given element
reverse() – Reverses the list
size() – Returns the number of elements in the list
sort() – Sorts the list in increasing order
