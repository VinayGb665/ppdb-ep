Given an array, find elements which appears prime number of times in the array with minimum k frequency (frequency >= k).
Examples :
Approach :
1. Create a Map which holds the number as Key and value as its occurrences in the input array.
2. Iterate the Map keys and look for the values corresponding to their keys, return the key which
   has minimum value fulfilling condition keyâ€™s value is a prime number and >= min occurrence provided
