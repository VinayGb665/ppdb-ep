What could be the maximum value of Y in the following equation given that neither of X, Y, Z is zero?
5X8 + 3Y4 + 2Z1 = 1103
(A) 0
(B) 7
(C) 8
(D) 9
 Answer: (B) Explanation: 
Clearly, X + Y + Z + 1 = 10
=> X + Y + Z = 9
Now, since neither of X, Y, Z can be zero, the value of Y will be maximum when X = Z = 1.
=> Max Y = 7Quiz of this Question
