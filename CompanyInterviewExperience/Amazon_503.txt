Round 1 (Online):
It had 20 MCQs and 2 coding questions for 90 minutes. Questions were from Operating Systems, Data structures, Aptitude etc. Most of them were exactly same as on www.geeksquiz.com. 
In MCQs there was – 0.25 marking for every wrong answer and +1 for right answer. Coding questions were of 10 marks each.
 

You are given n strings and you have to find their decimal representation. You have to print the string and corresponding decimal representation in descending order. For example, if you are given “amazon” then its corresponding decimal notation will be 262966. If more than one strings have same decimal notation then you have to print them in the order in which input is given. The given string consists of lower case alphabets only.

Round 2 (Face to Face):
Q1. Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes.
Q2. Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the maximum difference between any two elements such that larger element appears after the smaller number in arr[]. Print the indices of the two elements also.
Example: If array is [2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1] then returned value should be 8 (difference between 10 and 2). If array is [ 7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2 ] then returned value should be 2 (difference between 7 and 9).
Round 3 (Face to Face):

Entry in the log file is like this:
User 1 visited Page 4
User 3 visited Page 2
User 7 visited Page 9
.
.
.
Design an efficient data structure which supports queries like the following:
Which page was visited by exactly 2 users in day?
Which page was visited by only one user exactly 2 times in a day?
Which page was visited by ‘User 3? more than 5 times in a day?
