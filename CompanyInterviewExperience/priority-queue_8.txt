Given a tree, print the level order traversal in sorted order.
Examples :

We have discussed a priority queue based solution in below post.
Print Binary Tree levels in sorted order | Set 1 (Using Priority Queue)
In this post, a set (which is implemented using balanced binary search tree) based solution is discussed.
Approach :
1. Start level order traversal of tree.
2. Store all the nodes in a set(or any other similar data structures).
3. Print elements of set.
