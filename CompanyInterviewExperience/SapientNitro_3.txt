Â Â Â Â 	To many of my friends, it was a puzzle round and they faced only puzzles(8-9). But i got lucky, I was asked 4-5 puzzles and jumped into technical questions
puzzles:- 
		1. I was to imagine a situation where thereâ€™s is an empty wet, water spilled room(ceiling to floor height- 12 ft), a dead man(7 ft height) hung by a 3 ft rope. Iâ€™m asked how could the man hung himself there?
		reply:- I said there had been a 2ft ice cube on which he might have stood and tied himself and hung, (ice cube melting away killing him)
		2. Iâ€™m given 8 sticks to use to make two squares and four right angled triangles
			reply:- a rhombus inside a square
		3. I was given two non-uniform sticks which burn one hour each. I had to measure 15 minutes using them.
			reply:- I set one stick to fire on both ends and the other stick on only end. I let the first stick burn completely which measures me 30 minutes. Then I put the other end of the burning second stick on fire and let it burn completely. Now, the second stick takes 15 minutes to burn completely
		4. I was given 9 balls which all are identical except one which is hollow! How many trials would you take to figure out the hollow one!
			reply:- logarithmic answer. log 9 base 3 . i Said its two trials, I donâ€™t know if its a right answer

	He asked me to explain about my project which was on Service Oriented architecture for building a middleware in JADE. I explained it all to him. I wonder how much he might have understood.
HR Interview
	It started with him telling about himself. He told his position and his work role. I couldnâ€™t get a single thing of what he was talking about. :p Flew over my head ðŸ˜€
	Then i started to tell about myself, strengths weakness, hobbies.
	He asked why i like listening music a lot. I was like- I love it without any reason.
	He asked me if i like maths. I said no! ðŸ˜€ He gave me a small problem
		How many squares are there on a chess board.
		without further thinking, i spit out 64. He asked for my surity. Then i thought and said no(there are plenty of them inside, bigger and nested squares)
		so, i gave up, he finally told me the answer. (sum of squares of numbers from 1 to 8)
	He asked about software development life cycle. I gave an honest reply i forgot. Then he started scolding me saying that my pointer is 8.30 and i forgot this! He started saying to go prepared for the next interview.
	Then he asked me what if i donâ€™t perform well if they hired me.
		i said- kick my ass.
	He started giving me life lessons in hindi.
	Then he asked me what would i want first in process of making tea. (related to software development life cycle)
	i said- gas(fire). but he says the first step would be knowing the no. of people who will drink that and what are their requirements(same as a software needs)
Thatâ€™s it. It ended. and after news came over. I got selected :p 
Tips:- 
Â Â Â Â 	In tech interview, be confident about your answers, and donâ€™t ever guess any answer. Be honest and say you donâ€™t know if you donâ€™t and yes if you know.
Â Â Â Â 	In HR interview, be what you are. Reflect entirely yourself there. Donâ€™t be moody and shy. Try to converse with him as a friend. Heâ€™s there to select you rather than to reject you. 
All the best guys ðŸ˜€
