Given a number d, representing the number of digits of a positive integer. Find the total count of positive integer (consisting of d digits exactly) which have at-least one zero in them.
Examples: 


One Simple Solution is to traverse through all d digit positive numbers.  For every number, traverse through its digits and if there is any 0 digit, increment count (similar to this).
Following are some observations: 

So considering the above points, letâ€™s find the total count of numbers having d digits:
Below is the program for the same.
