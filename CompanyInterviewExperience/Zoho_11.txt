2. Find the result subtraction, multiplication, division of two integers using + operator.
Input: 6 and 4
output:
addition 6+4 = 10,    subtraction  6+(-4) = 2,   multiplication = 24,   division = 1
Input : -8 and -4
Output:
addition -8+(-4) = -12,    subtraction  (-8)+(-(-4)) = -4,   multiplication = 32,   division = 2
 
3.Given a sentence of string, in that remove the palindrome words and print the remaining.

Output: 393
dt1 represents “10-Feb-2014” and dt2 represents “10-Mar-2015” The difference is 365 + 28
Input: dt1 = {10, 2, 2000} dt2 = {10, 3, 2000}
Output: 29
Note that 2000 is a leap year
Input: dt1 = {10, 2, 2000} dt2 = {10, 2, 2000}
Output: 0
Both dates are same
Input: dt1 = {1, 2, 2000}; dt2 = {1, 2, 2004};
Output: 1461
Number of days is 365*4 + 1
 
5.
Let 1 represent ‘A’, 2 represents ‘B’, etc. Given a digit sequence, count the number of possible decodings of the given digit sequence.
