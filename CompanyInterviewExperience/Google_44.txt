In MS-Paint, when we take the brush to a pixel and click, the color of the region of that pixel is replaced with a new selected color.  Following is the problem statement to do this task. 
Given a 2D screen,  location of a pixel in the screen and a color, replace color of the given pixel and all adjacent same colored pixels with the given color.
Example: 
Flood Fill Algorithm:
The idea is simple, we first replace the color of current pixel, then recur for 4 surrounding points. The following is detailed algorithm. 
The following is C++ implementation of above algorithm.
Run on IDE
