Please find the details of my amazon interviews below.
Date of Interviews:Â 22nd August 2012
No of Rounds: 1 Written + 4 PI
Type of Interviews:Â Campus Interview for freshers

Written Test (Time): 90 Minutes
20 Objective Questions: Aptitude and basic C objective problems.
2 Subjective Questions:
I.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To find if there is any root to leaf path with specified sum in a binary tree.
II.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Some question based on sorting.

Interview Round 1(60-70 Minutes):
Technical Interview
Question 1:Â Check if a character link list is palindrome or not.
Question 2:Â A sorted array has been rotated r times to the left. Find r in least possible time.
Question 3:Â Clone a singly link list whose nodes contain, apart from next pointers, an extra pointer to any random node. The random pointer of a node N could be after N, before N or the node N itself.

Interview Round 2(50-60 Minutes):
Technical Interview
Question 1:Â There is a big file of words which is dynamically changing. We are continuously adding some words into it. How would you keep track of top 10 trending words at each moment?
Question 2:Â Write code for minHeapify() operation.
Question 3:Â Design a data structure for the following operations:
I.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Enqueue
II.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Dequeue
III.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Delete a given number(if it is present in the queue, else do nothing)
IV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  isNumberPresent
All these operations should take O(1) time.
Question 4:Â Write a function that returns the length of the longest leaf-to-leaf path in a binary tree.

Interview Round 3(60-70 Minutes):
Technical Interview
Question 1:Â There is a binary tree of size N. All nodes are numbered between 1-N(inclusive). There is a N*N integer matrix Arr[N][N], all elements are initialized to zero. So for all the nodes A and B, put Arr[A][B] = 1 if A is an ancestor of B (NOTÂ just the immediate ancestor).
Question 2:Â Find an element in a sorted rotated integer array.
Question 3:Â There is a N*N integer matrix Arr[N][N]. From the row r and column c, we can go to any of the following three indices:
I.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Arr[ r+1 ][ c-1 ] (valid only if c-1>=0)
II.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Arr[ r+1 ][ c ]
III.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Arr[ r+1 ][ c+1 ] (valid only if c+1<=N-1)
So if we start at any column index on row 0, what is the largest sum of any of the paths till row N-1.

Interview Round 4(40-50 Minutes):
Bar Raiser Round
Interviewer asked HR Questions Initially, then a sort of puzzle.
Two robots land with their parachutes on an infinite one-dimensional number line. They both release their parachutes as soon as they land and start moving. They are allowed only to make use of the following functions.
I.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â moveLeft() // robot moves to left by 1 unit in 1 unit time
II.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â moveRight() // robot moves to right by 1 unit in 1 unit time
III.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â noOperation() // robot does not move and takes 1 unit time
IV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â onTopOfParachute() // returns true if the robot is standing on top of either of the parachute, else false
V.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â didWeMeet() // returns true if the robot meets to the other robot, else false
Write a function in order to make the robots meet each other. Robots will be executing the same copy of this function.

Tips / Advice:
I.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Each time you write a code, check for the edge cases.
II.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Do not assume anything. Keep asking questions if there are any doubts.
