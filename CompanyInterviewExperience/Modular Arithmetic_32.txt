Given two positive integer x and y. we have to find the value of y mod 2x. That is remainder when y is divided by 2x.
Examples:

To solve this question we can use pow() and modulo operator and can easily find the remainder.
But there are some points we should care about:
keeping in mind the above points we can approach this problem as :
Note:  As python is limit free we can directly use mod and pow() function
