Given a number n, the task is to print first n Fibonacci numbers.
Prerequisite : Program to print first n Fibonacci Numbers | Set 1
Examples :


N-th Fibonacci Number = [(1 + √5)n – (1 – √5)n)] / [2n * √5]
Run on IDE
Note :  The above program is costly compared to method 1 as it causes power computations in floating point. Also, it may not work perfect due to floating point precision errors.
