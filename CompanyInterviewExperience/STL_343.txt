Priority queues are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed such that the first element of the queue is the greatest of all elements in the queue.
push() function is used to insert an element in the priority  queue. The element is added to the priority queue container and the size of the queue is increased by 1. Firstly, the element is added at the back and at the same time the elements of the priority queue reorder themselves according to priority.
