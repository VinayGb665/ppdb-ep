Round 1:
1. Incoming stream of characters () defines an onion of depth 1, (()) of 2.  Find all onions with their in an incoming stream of characters. Discuss complexity.
Stream can be (()) () )) ((( (
2. Biggest challenge faced / where you innovated?
Resume Project:
i. Demonstrate High Level Design
3. Parking Lot Problem A, B , C lots with different car sizes.  Efficient way of allocating available slot.
A: Maintain linked list of available slots. Complexity discussion.
Round 2:
1. Matrix of 1s and 0s. 1s are sorted in beginning of each row.  Find
an efficient way of finding the row with maximum 0s in it.
A: Find row which has lowest sum. Complexity discussion. 
2. How to find two sets(of size m,n) are dis-joint(have no elements common) efficiently
A: Use hash map. Complexity is O(n) in worst case.
Follow up Q: How are hash maps stored in memory?
