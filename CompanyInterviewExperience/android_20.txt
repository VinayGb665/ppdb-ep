I applied for the profile of  Android developer after seeing the opening on LinkedIn. Experience of 1-3 years was required. I mailed directly to the HR for my interest in the aforementioned role. In less than a day, I got a call from HR asking me about me about my  development experience after which she scheduled my interview with a senior developer .
Round 1: 
It was a 1 hour Hangout interview. This round was mainly concerned with Android and Java specifics. Deep knowledge and internal working of components and frameworks were assessed in this round.
Questions asked were:
After this round, I was given an assignment to make an Android app using Zomato search API. Functionalities expected were infinite recyclerview (pagination), filter for restaurant list and searchview for searching restaurants .
Round 2:
Based on the previous round, I was selected for second round. This too took place on Hangouts. It was DS Algo round. It started with discussion about my projects and internships. After that questions related to some random concepts were asked like what are usecases of push and pull mechanism. She initially told me about push and pull and then asked me about the usecases. Finally, two coding questions were to be solved on a collaborative editor.
Round 3:
This round was scheduled with the VP of engineering. Again a hangouts interview. He asked me about my background and what are the main reason I opted for Android followed by a long discussion on my projects.
Overall, the whole process took 14 days.
