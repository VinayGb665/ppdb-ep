Company : commonfloor.com (MaxHeap Technologies)
Criteria : Open to CSE , EE , EC , MA ; No CGPA Criteria
Qualifier Round: on hackerearth.com
1 hr 30 min : 5 Objective Questions and 1 Coding Question.
1) Definition of Foreign Key (DBMS).
2) No. of colors needed to colour any Planar Graph
3) Minimum Hamming Distance to detect error ….
4) No of nodes in a complete binary tree of height h
5) Equality of two regular expressions (Identity based).
Coding Question :
You are given the vertices , edges , start vertex and end vertex of a
graph .The graph is directed and can have loops .Each edge is of length 1 . You task is to find the min distance b/w start and end vertex if it is reachable , else print (-1)*(#Vertices reacheable from start vertex) 
BFS is obvious .Only thing is that Graph must be implemented as Adjacency List rather than Adj Matrix else it causes Memory Limit Exceeded error.
