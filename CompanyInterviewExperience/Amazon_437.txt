Given a Linked List. The Linked List is in alternating ascending and descending orders. Sort the list efficiently. 
Example:
A Simple Solution is to use Merge Sort for linked List. This solution takes O(n Log n) time. 
An Efficient Solution works in O(n) time.  Below are all steps.
1. Separate two lists.
2. Reverse the one with descending order
3. Merge both lists. 
Below are C++ and Java implementations of above algorithm.
