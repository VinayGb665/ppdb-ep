Given a binary string, count number of substrings that start and end with 1. For example, if the input string is “00100101”, then there are three substrings “1001”, “100101” and “101”.

A Simple Solution is to run two loops. Outer loops picks every 1 as starting point and inner loop searches for ending 1 and increments count whenever it finds 1.

Time Complexity of the above solution is O(n2). We can find count in O(n) using a single traversal of input string. Following are steps.
a) Count the number of 1’s. Let the count of 1’s be m.
b) Return m(m-1)/2
The idea is to count total number of possible pairs of 1’s.
