Lists are containers used in C++ to store data in a non contiguous fashion, Normally, Arrays and Vectors are contiguous in nature, therefore the insertion and deletion operations are costlier as compared to the insertion and deletion option in Lists.
begin() function is used to return an iterator pointing to the first element of the list container. It is different from the front() function because the front function returns a reference to the first element of the container but begin() function returns a bidirectional iterator to the first element of the container.

1. It has a no exception throw guarantee.
2. Shows error when a parameter is passed.

end() function is used to return an iterator pointing to the last element of the list container. It is different from the back() function because the back() function returns a reference to the last element of the container but end() function returns a bidirectional iterator to the last element of the container.
