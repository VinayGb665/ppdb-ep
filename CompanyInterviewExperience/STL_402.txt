Symmetric difference of two sorted ranges
The symmetric difference of two sets is formed by the elements that are present in one of the sets, but not in the other. Among the equivalent elements in each range, those discarded are those that appear before in the existent order before the call. The existing order is also preserved for the copied elements.
The elements are compared using operator< for the first version, and comp for the second. Two elements, a and b are considered equivalent if (!(a<b) && !(b<a)) or if (!comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a)).
The elements in the ranges shall already be ordered.
