Round 1:Written Test – 90 min
It comprises of 15 questions mainly from the topic OOPs concept , Coding Question(Linked List, Binary tree , Array Manipulation) and Pointer.
Q.1)Given a binary search tree and a given key node. Print all the node from root to the nearest leaf node containing the the key node.
Q.2) Write a program to reverse the Singly Linked list
Example:
Initially – 1->2->3->4->5
Finally – 5->4->3->2->1
Q.3) Find the output of following code:
Q.4)Find the ouput of following code:
Q.5) Write a program to find the trailing zeros of factorial of a given number.
Example:
n = 12
Output = 2
Q.6) Find the output of following:
Q.7)Find the output of following:
Assume size of  member variable a,b,c be 6,4,4 respectively.
Q.8) Find the output of following:
Q.9) Write a program to find maxm sum of continuous subarray of  a array.
Example:
7
3 4 -5 9 4 -12 2
Output – 15
Q.10) Find the ouput of following code:
Output – Compile time error
Q.11)Write a program to find the first non-repeating character from the stream of characters.
Q.12)Write a program to put all zero elements before non-zero elements from a given array
Example:
2 0 3 4 0 0 1 0
output – 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 1
1 question from Multi-threading and other 2 are code-snippet , which I forgotten.
Note – Try to solve all Coding questions with minimum time and space complexity.
On the same day evening, the results were out and total 6 students out of 54 got selected for further rounds. Fortunately, I was one of them
Round 2:Technical + HR Interview(Around 45 min)
Then they asked some Hr Question-
1) Tell me your family background.
2) why should we hire you.
 
The final result came after 5 days and out of 6, only 2 students got selected, I was one of them.
