Given three numbers, our task is to find the largest number by which when given 3 numbers are divided leads to same remainder. It may be assumed that all given numbers are given in increasing order.
Examples:

The idea is based on the fact that if a number leaves same remainder with a, b and c, then it would divide their differences. Let us understand assuming that x is our result. Let a = x*d1 + r where r is the remainder when a is divided by x. Similarly we can write b = x*d2 + r and b = x*d3 + r. So the logic is here we first find differences of all three pairs and after that, we find greatest common divisor of differences to maximize result.
Below is the implementation of above idea.
