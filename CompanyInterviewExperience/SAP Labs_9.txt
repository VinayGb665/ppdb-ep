This is my interview experience for Scholar@SAP program. You can read about this program here. There hire both Engineering and non engineering students. This interview experience is for Engineering students hiring.
Round 1: (Online Round) – 80 min (No negative marking was there)
This round was conducted on  October 4,  2017. 
Test Platform -Mettl
It consisted of 5 sections.
1. General Aptitude
2. Verbal Ability
3. Computer Skills
4. Coding Skills
5. Design aptitude
There were 2 coding questions in Coding Skills section. First Questions was based on fibonacci series for alphabets and second was based on coin change problem.
All the 5 sections were very easy.  Around 400-500 students gave this online test. They selected only 34 students for Interview Process.
TIP: Attempt both coding questions very carefully as you have to pass all the test cases for both questions.
Round 2: Technical  – 30 min
Round 2 was a Technical Interview/Test . In this interview they divided us in groups and conducted a pen-paper test. This test was to check the basic knowlendge of subjects.
There were 3 Questions in this and the time was 30 minutes.

Q2. Design a database model for an Online Food Ordering website. (ER Diagram + schemas for all the tables)
Q3. Given an array of numbers. Divide this array into two different arrays one with prime no.s and other with non-prime no.s
It was an easy round but they eliminated 24 students in this round. Only 10 students went to next round.
Tip: Attempt important questions first.
Round 3: Technical (ONE on ONE) – about 50-55 min
 Round 3 was a One to One Technical Interview. Interviewer was very friendly. He asked me about my interests. Then he asked me to design a game. Game was like this: “There is a 3*3 matrix which contains no. from 1 to 99. These numbers are filled randomly and after every 20 seconds later matrix refills itself. Player is asked to input a number. If the number entered by the user is equal to the maximum of the numbers present in matrix at that time, then Player is awarded with +2 points. Otherwise 1 point is deducted from the score. Game continues until total score becomes negative.” I designed this game but i forgot the case when number generated by random function is already present in array. But once interviewer reminded me for that,  i corrected that too . Next was a puzzle related related with filling of numbers in a diagram. then next question was related with property of outside angle of a triangle. Then he asked me to write a program  to print all permutations of a given string. I wrote that too. This was last question for the interview.
It was an easy round but they eliminated only 1 student in this round. 9 students went to HR round.
Tip: Always tell what you are thinking to the interviewer, don’t be silent.
Round 4: HR -10 to 15 minutes
In HR interview  they asked general HR questions like your strengths, weakness, family background etc.  and then they asked about  company , SAP products, Why SAP? etc.
Out of 9 students, 6 students were selected but unfortunately i was not among them.
TIP: No tip as i was also not able to made through. 😉 ;-P
