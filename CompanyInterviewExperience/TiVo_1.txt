I would like to share my interview experience with you. The company name is TiVo(earlier known as Rovi corporation). So here it goes:
TiVo came to our campus to hire for the role of Associate Software Developer. Their process included 5 rounds â€“ 1 online round, 3 technical rounds and 1 HR round.
Round 1 (Online test on hackerrank) : We had 20 MCQ questions on basics of DSA, C/C++, OOP, OS, Aptitude and 1 puzzle. Time for the test was 1 hour. The questions were little tricky and required strong concepts of all the above mentioned topics. 25 horse puzzle was asked.
Round 2 (Technical Interview 1) : My first round was scheduled late in the night around 3AM so the interviewer didnâ€™t waste time in asking questions like tell me about yourself etc. This round was more focused on DSA basics and coding questions. He started with LRU cache. Then asked me basic questions like what is mergesort, when does the worst case of QuickSort occur. Then he asked me 2 dp questions â€“
Round 3 (Technical Interview 2): This round started at 4.30 in the morning. HE asked me two questions in this round.
Round 4 (Technical Interview 3): This round was taken by a manager. He also asked 2 questions:
I was called for the HR round. It started at 830AM and lasted for about 15 mins.
Round 5 (HR round): Basic questions like Why TiVo. I was the Vice captain of college cricket team so he asked what challenges did you face during your tenure etc.
Verdict: Placed ðŸ™‚
Advice: It is never too late for anything. As I am from Electrical background I had very less coding experience and I had not studied DSA, DBMS, OS and Networks. I started 4 months back and followed GeeksForGeeks like a bible.
Try to do questions before looking at the solution and practice writing code on paper.
Thanks GeeksForGeeks for putting up such a solid content.
