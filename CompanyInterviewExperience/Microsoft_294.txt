Round 1: (1 h)
==============
Q1. Design a Garbage collector like java. How would you detect depended reference loop? 
Hist : Class design, Cycle detection algorithms for disjoint graph( List of connected graph)
Q2. Find an element in a sorted rotated array in O(logn ) complexity.
Round 2:(1.h 15min)
===================
Q1. Given a sorted array having duplicate elements,how would you find first index of a given element in O(logn).
Write code for it. Change the condition to find out last index of that elements.
[ Hint Binary search]
Q2. You have a dictionary of words. Given a word, print all anagram are in dictionary . State the data structure to be used to solve this problem.
Q3. Design a Chip-Encryption system. Which will do following operation:
1. Take a word from user
2. Encrypt the word by some Private or public key cryptography or any other algo.
3. Transmit the encrypted word by TCP or UDp or SSL.
Design the class diagram using OOD. Which design pattern you are using to achieve this.
Round 3:(1.h 15min)
===================
Q1. In a plane n points (X and Y) is given. How will you find out maximum co-liner points. Extend this algorithms. it for point(x,y,z) in 3D plane. 
Q2. Reverse a 32-bit integers. write code for it.
Q3. What the different issue in multi-threading ? What is the difference between mutex and semaphore.
Q4. You have a file with million words in it. Find most frequent 10 word in that file. Node that you can store all word in memory.
(Note : Min-Heap + List )
Round 4 :
Skipped â€¦ ðŸ™‚
Round 5( 2h 30 min)
===================
Q1. You are given a Text, where all space, full stop and all punctuation mark is removed. You want to reconstruct the text by putting spaces between words.
A dict is given and following API < bool isInDect(word) > is also given.
a) Decide if the text can be converted a sentence with valid words or NOT.
b) Find how many way you can do the reconstruction of the text.
c) Find what is the minimum number of space can be used for this reconstruction.
d) For case (c)  find out the indexes where you suppose to put a space.
e) Now recover the text to sentence in place .
Subsequent Question:
1. Why Greedy technique will not work for this?
2. yes ! Backtracking will work, what is the problem of using backtracking ?
3. Illustrate and explain how the solution is contracted from the Dynamic table ?
4. Write the correct working code for (c),(d),(e).
Q2. Given a BST, find out the minimum length form root to leaf with sum S. Note that:
a) Path from root to leaf node.
b) Sum of node of the path is S.
c) if multiple such path exist, print minimum length path.
d) What is advantage of BST rather than BT used for this algorithm, how it improve the performance. in BST, is it required to explore both side ?
e) Write working codes for it.
Status: Selected ! (The interview call was for SDE-I, but they offer me for  SDE -II(L61) position)
