Given a string consisting of only 0, 1, A, B, C where
A = AND
B = OR
C = XOR
Calculate the value of the string assuming no order of precedence and evaluation is done from left to right.
Constraints â€“ The length of string will be odd. It will always be a valid string.
Example, 1AA0 will not be given as an input.

The idea is to traverse all operands by jumping a character after every iteration.  For current operand str[i], check values of str[i+1] and str[i+2], accordingly decide the value of current subexpression.
