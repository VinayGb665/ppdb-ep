Zoho had visited our college to recruit software developers. There were two types of salary package offered and also internships.
These were the rounds:
Round 1 â€“ Online Test
There were 30 questions. 15 aptitude and 15 coding related (from C)
Aptitude was quite simple but the coding questions were really challenging.
The cut-off was pretty high as this was a round meant for mass filtering.
Round 2 â€“ Coding 
This was a hands-on coding round with 8 questions.
You could use C, C++ or JAVA
Most of the questions were easy:
Given 4 integers as input. Find whether they would form a rectangle, square or none.
Insert an element at a particular index in an array.
Some were average:
Given a large number convert it to the base 7.
Given an IP address validate it based on the given conditions.
Sort parts of an array separately using peak values.
Some were a bit challenging:
Given an input array, find the number of occurrences of a particular number without looping (use hashing)
Diamond pattern printing based on some conditions
Given an array of characters print the characters that have â€˜nâ€™ number of occurrences. If a character appears consecutively it is counted as 1 occurrence
Eg: a b a a b c c d e d
Here a has only 2 occurrences
Round 3 & 4 â€“ Advanced coding:
In these rounds we were asked to implement the logic for 2 games
â€“ Minesweeper
â€“ Breakout a.k.a. Arkanoid a.k.a. Brick-Breaker (youâ€™ll find it online)
The game was split into various stages and we were asked to implement the logic stage by stage.
Interviews:
A few interviews followed. Some of which was just to get to know you. One interview had a few puzzles. And one was an official interview with a lead HR from Zoho
Those who did really well got the higher package and those who just missed it also got the job with a lower package.
Some were offered internships.
Overall it was a challenging process. Those with strong logical and coding skills would make it ðŸ™‚
