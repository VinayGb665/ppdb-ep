Given a number n, we need to count square numbers smaller than or equal to n.
Examples :

A simple solution is to traverse through all numbers from 1 to n and for every number check if n is perfect square or not. 
An efficient solution is based on below formula.
Count of square numbers that are greater than 0 and smaller than or equal to n are floor(sqrt(n)) or ⌊√(n)⌋
Count of non-square numbers = n – ⌊√(n)⌋
