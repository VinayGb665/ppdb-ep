OFSS visited our campus for recruiting associate application developer .
There were 3 rounds in all
1) online test
2) technical interview
3) HR interview 
1) Online Test
       The test broadly consisted of 4 sections
      – Coding outputs (mainly trees, AVL trees)
      – English (Grammar,RC)
      – Computer Science subjects (DBMS,OS,DS)
      – Aptitude 
The test lasted for 2 hours. The key here is managing time. Questions were of average level but time was not sufficient .
I was shortlisted for 2nd interview .
2) Technical interview
     The interviewer was very friendly . He started by “tell me about yourself” . He then asked me
    – Normalization in DBMS with examples
    – Different sorting algorithms and their implementation in real life.
    – Doubly linked list with real time examples.
    – Minor project
    – Internship
    – Difference between UNION and UNION ALL
    – Difference between UNION and JOIN
    – Different types of JOIN with examples.
He was impressed with my minor project and internship .
He also concentrated on communication skills and confidence.
3) HR interview
         Very general questions. Strength and weakness. Asked about location preference .
