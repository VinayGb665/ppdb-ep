Given a binary tree containing n nodes. The problem is to get the sum of all the leaf nodes which are at minimum level in the binary tree.
Examples:
Source: Microsoft IDC Interview Experience | Set 150.

Approach: Perform iterative level order traversal using queue and find the first level containing a leaf node. Sum up all the leaf nodes at this level and then stop performing the traversal further.

Output:
Time Complexity: O(n).
Auxiliary Space: O(n).
