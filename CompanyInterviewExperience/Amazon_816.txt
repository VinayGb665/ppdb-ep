Output: 
The above code doesn’t handle the cases when the string starts with space.  The following version handles this specific case and doesn’t make unnecessary calls to reverse function in the case of multiple space in between.  Thanks to rka143 for providing this version.

Time Complexity: O(n)
In Python, we csn do the above task by splitting and saving the string in reverse manner
