Given a binary tree, print level order traversal in a way that nodes of all levels are printed in separate lines.
For example consider the following tree
Note that this is different from simple level order traversal where we need to print all nodes together. Here we need to print nodes of different levels in different lines.
A simple solution is to print use the recursive function discussed in the level order traversal post and print a new line after every call to printGivenLevel().

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n2)
How to modify the iterative level order traversal (Method 2 of this) to levels line by line?
The idea is similar to this post. We count the nodes at current level. And for every node, we enqueue its children to queue.

Time complexity of this method is O(n) where n is number of nodes in given binary tree.
