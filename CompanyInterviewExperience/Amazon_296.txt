Recruiter at amazon are very friendly. For each question working code was expected and time and space complexity was asked.
Interact with the interviewer if you get stuck. Try to come up to different approach to solve the same problem. Their main focus remains on how you see a problem and try to solve the problem. Dont jump to code it as soon as you are given the problem, first discuss it then go for coding if asked.
Be confident and do not give up if you cant get the perfect solution!!
