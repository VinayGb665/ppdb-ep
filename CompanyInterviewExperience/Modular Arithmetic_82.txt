The interviewer asked me 6 technical questions for which he helped me getting the most optimized approach.
I can’t recall the rest questions.
Then he asked me a simple DBMS design question. I had to implement student and subjects relation. Then asked me to normalize the schema. He also asked some theory questions from OS and DBMS.
Round 4 (Technical Interview):
The Interviewer asked me 3 coding questions and a lot of theory questions from DBMS and OS. Determine if two rectangles overlap or not. If they do, then separate them in a given size of screen. The program should print appropriate message if separation is not possible. He basically wanted a mathematical approach. He also asked all the possible orientation of the rectangles.
The interviewer helped wherever I got stuck.
