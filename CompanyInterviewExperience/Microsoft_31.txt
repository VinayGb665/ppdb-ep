Given a large number N and the task is to check if any permutation of a large number is divisible by 8.
Examples:
A naive approach is to generate all permutations of the number N and check if(N % 8 == 0) and return true if any of the permutations is divisible by 8. 
An efficient approach is to use the fact that if the last three digits of a number are divisible by 8, then the number is also divisible by 8. Below are the required steps:
Below is the implementation of the above approach:
