For the given length n, find all n-length Strobogrammatic numbers. 
Strobogrammatic Number is a number whose numeral is rotationally symmetric so that it appears the same when rotated 180 degrees. In other words, Strobogrammatic Number appears the same right-side up and upside down.

0 after 180°  rotation : (0 → 0)
1 after 180°  rotation : (1 → 1)
8 after 180°  rotation : (8 → 8)
6 after 180°  rotation : (6 → 9)
9 after 180°  rotation : (9 → 6)
