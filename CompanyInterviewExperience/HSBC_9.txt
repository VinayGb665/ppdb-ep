Round 1 :  Online web cam monitored test- technical 20 questions,  aptitude 20 questions,  English 20 questions(75 min).   Coding round- 2 questions (marks increase if space and time complexity of the code is less) (30 min)
Round 2 : Group Discussion on some common topics- mine was “Android vs iOS”, in one group it was “red circle”. Pretty easy if you are confident.
Round 3 : Technical interview round
This round took about one hour.  It was moderately difficult. I was asked questions from the resume itself. Project: 3 questions. The interviewer mostly checks the basics. Even if you don’t know an answer, tell him, you’ve learnt it but cannot recollect. Be very confident.
Apart from project:
Round 4: HR round- consisted of basic questions: Why HSBC, Will you be able to travel, Strengths, weaknesses, difference between obsessive and possessive, family background., puzzle- cut a cake in 8 equal pieces with 3 cuts. Remember to be very confident all the time. Trust me, I’ve had six interview experiences till date. Confidence = you’ll clear it for sure.
The interviewer may behave as if he’s criticizing you. That is just the part of grilling. Don’t worry. Stay calm. Keep your smile even during stress.
