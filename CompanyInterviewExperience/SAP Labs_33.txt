My interview experience was as follows:
Round 1- Online Test (Time: 90 min)
Try out coding first as they carry more weightage and before attempting them read the compiler instructions carefully. 
Round 2- Technical Interview (Time: 1 hr)
Round 3- Managerial Interview (Time: 45 min)
 Round 4- HR Interview (Time: 40 min)
 
All interviewers were helpful and nice. Be confident and be attentive in placement talk. SAP interviewers deeply check into resumes, so be quite sure on the topics you have mentioned. After the process, the interviewers took new recruits for a dinner.
I would like to thank geeks for geeks for archive of previous interviews that helped me during the process.
