Given a number you have to check whether there is pair of adjacent set bit or not.
Examples :

A simple solution is traverse all bits. For every set bit, check if next bit is also set.
An efficient solution is to shift number by 1 and then do bitwise AND. If bitwise AND is non-zero then there are two adjacent set bits. Else not.
