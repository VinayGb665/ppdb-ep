Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph, find Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of the graph using Kruskal’s algorithm.
We have discussed below Kruskal’s MST implementations.
Greedy Algorithms | Set 2 (Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm)
Below are the steps for finding MST using Kruskal’s algorithm
Here are some key points which will be useful for us in implementing the Kruskal’s algorithm using STL.
Here in the outer pair (i.e pair<int,pair<int,int> > ) the first element corresponds to the cost of a edge while the second element is itself a pair, and it contains two vertices of edge.
Pseudo Code: 
Below is C++ implementation of above algorithm.
Run on IDE
Output :
Optimization:
The above code can be optimized to stop the main loop of Kruskal when number of selected edges become V-1. We know that MST has V-1 edges and there is no point iterating after V-1 edges are selected. We have not added this optimization to keep code simple.
