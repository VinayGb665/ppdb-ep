Accolite Interview Experience (On-Campus)
Round 1 (Written)
Around 190 students appeared for the online test which consists of 30MCQâ€™s to be done in 30minutes, questions were basically from data structure, networking, dbms, and 2-3 questions of apti also. You need to pass out the cutoff in this round, also remember negative marking was there.
They shortlisted 12 students in this round.
Round 2 (Coding)

After that online coding round was there in which 2 questions were given in 1hour.
They shortlisted 4 students in this round and I got lucky J.
Round 3 Technical Interview (1.30 hour)
I was the first to be interviewed.
Round 4 Technical Interview (2.30 hour)

They took 2 rounds of all 4 candidates, then selected 2 for the third round, I was being one. ðŸ˜€
Round 5 (Technical+HR) Interview (2 hour)

I would suggest that your approach and concepts must be strong as they always give questions with some variations and tell them your thinking process and interact with them and ask more and more questions.
