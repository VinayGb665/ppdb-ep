Given a sorted array of strings which is interspersed with empty strings, write a method to find the location of a given string.
Examples:
If there were no empty strings then we couldâ€™ve simply performed binary search. We can still use Binary Search with a little modification. If our mid is empty we just have to move mid to closest Non-Empty string.
Below is a C++ solution for above approach.
