Merge Sort is a popular sorting technique which divides an array or list into two halves and then start merging them when sufficient depth is reached. Time complexity of merge sort is O(nlogn).
Threads are lightweight processes and threads shares with other threads their code section, data section and OS resources like open files and signals. But, like process, a thread has its own program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack space.
Multi-threading is way to improve parallelism  by running the threads simultaneously in different cores of your processor. In this program, weâ€™ll use 4 threads but you may change it according to the number of cores your processor has.
Examples:

Note* It is better to execute the program in linux based system.
To compile in linux System :
Run on IDE
Output:
