Given an array (or string), the task is to reverse the array/string.
Examples :
Iterative way :
1) Initialize start and end indexes as start = 0, end = n-1
2) In a loop, swap arr[start] with arr[end] and change start and end as follows :
    start = start +1, end = end â€“ 1

Another example to reverse a string:

Below is the implementation of the above approach :

Time Complexity : O(n)
Recursive Way :
1) Initialize start and end indexes as start = 0, end = n-1
2) Swap arr[start] with arr[end]
3) Recursively call reverse for rest of the array.
Below is the implementation of the above approach :

Please write comments if you find any bug in the above programs or other ways to solve the same problem.
