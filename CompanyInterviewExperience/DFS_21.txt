Given n nodes of a forest (collection of trees), find the number of trees in the forest.
Examples :

Approach :
1. Apply DFS on every node.
2. Increment count by one if every connected node is visited from one source.
3. Again perform DFS traversal if some nodes yet not visited.
4. Count will give the number of trees in forest.
