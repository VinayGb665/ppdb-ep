Given an array of integers arr[], find the number of recycled pairs in the array. A recycled pair of two numbers {a, b} has the following properties :

Examples:

Below is the step by step algorithm to solve the above problem:

Time Complexity : O(n*log(n)). 
Note: For any given integer, the maximum number of rotations to form new numbers are fixed that is (no_of_digits-1). Hence, this operation is constant time that is O(1).
