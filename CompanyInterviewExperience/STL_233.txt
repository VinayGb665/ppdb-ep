STL priority_queue is the implementation of Heap Data-structure.. By default, it’s a max heap and we can easily use it for primitive datatypes. There are some important applications of it which can be found here
Prerequisite:  Prioirty_queue Basics
In this article, we will see how can we use priority_queue for custom datatypes like class or structure.
suppose we have a structure name Person which consist of two variables Age and height 
and we want to store that that in priority_queue then a simple method won’t work here.
Given below is a example of declaration of struct Person:

On defining the Priority Queue as shown below, it’ll give us error since priority_queue doesn’t know on what order(min or max) we need to arrange the objects.
Run on IDE
To rectify the error above, we will  use operator overloading to define the priority. So that priority_queue can decide how to store the structure object.
Given below is the priority_queue implementation with structure below:
