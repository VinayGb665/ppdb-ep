First round was a test that had 35 questions having negative marks.
The test consisted of aptitude, technical questions in dbms, os,  programming questions, and there were 5 questions based on a case study which was about a language that was unlike sql and had different queries and operator styles, also different arguments. They had to be understood then and there in the paper and related questions were to be answered.
I got shortlisted and was called for the interview.
Round 1
The panel consisted of two people. They first asked me to introduce myself. I mentioned my strengths being Theory of Computation, Operating systems, Data structures, DBMS.
I cleared my round 1 and was subsequently called for the second round.
Round 2
I cleared the 2nd round as well and was called for the 3rd round.
Round 3
Opera solutions is a company all related to data and giving optimized solutions to clients. Since i wasn’t very much tested in DBMS and SQL till now, i was expecting that this was the round where i would be put to test in these areas.
That was all in round 3 which i cleared and went for my 4th round with the Asst Vice President of Opera solutions
Round 4
I finally managed to get through all the rounds and got the job offer from opera.
The important topics opera expects you to be good at are your technical skills especially DS, algorithms, DBMS and SQL, operating systems, case studies that test your analytical skills and puzzles and problem solving approaches.
Thank you GeeksforGeeks for helping me get through the interview. I had prepared many of the questions asked in the interview from GeeksforGeeks website and it helped me a lot.
