Eligibility Criteria: CGPA >= 5.0
Round 1: Technical Test
An online test held on HackerRank which consists of 20 MCQâ€™s and 2 coding questions.
MCQâ€™s
They were pretty simple you just need to have basic knowledge about Scheduling Algorithms, Threads and Time Complexity.Â In this section major portion was from the Operating Systems.
I would suggest you go through last minute notes on OS, they were life savior for me in Online round as well as in further round.
We were told that there will be only 2 Technical Rounds and No HR round.
Face to Face Round 1: (~1 hour)
Round 1 was over.
Face to Face Round 2 (~1.5 hour)
Then he asked me to code the HashMap approach, while coding I figured out the approach with O(1) extra space. Once I was done with the code I told him the other approach, he was satisfied, code wasnâ€™t required for the second approach.
That was all for the interview.
Result: Selected ðŸ˜€
Best of Luck to all of geeks for their placement season!!
