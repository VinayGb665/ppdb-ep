Given a list of items, sort them in increasing order.
Examples:
Strand Sort is a sorting algorithm that works in O(n) time if list is already sorted and works in O(n*n) in worst case.
Below are simple steps used in the algorithm.    
Illustration :
Below is the implementation of above algorithm. The C++ implementation uses list in C++ STL.
