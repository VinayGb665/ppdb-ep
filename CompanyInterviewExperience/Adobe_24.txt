Given a linked list, write a function to reverse every k nodes (where k is an input to the function). 
Examples:
We have already discussed its solution in below post
Reverse a Linked List in groups of given size | Set 1
In this post, we have used a stack which will store the nodes of the given linked list. Firstly, push the k elements of the linked list in the stack. Now pop elements one by one and keep track of the previously popped node. Point the next pointer of prev node to top element of stack. Repeat this process, until NULL is reached.
This algorithm uses O(k) extra space.
