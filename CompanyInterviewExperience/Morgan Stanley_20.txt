Conclusion: Company looks more at how you talk than what you know. Their whole mantra is, “we can teach you
about technology but we can’t teach you to be confident, talk to people, not be a mean, etc.” So keep that in mind. It’s okay if you don’t know the answer to a question but don’t just say “I don’t know”. They loves stories so let your inner J.K. Rowling out! All in all, be confident, smile a lot, don’t be nervous, and stay calm! That will take you very far in the job process! Good luck everyone! I considered the interview as “difficult”. My reason was not that the questions were difficult, but rather that you have 4+ interviews so it becomes difficult to keep the energy going, not to repeat yourself too much, come across personable, etc. Hope that helps!
