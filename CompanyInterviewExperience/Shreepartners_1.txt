Written was mixture of technical and aptitude. Aptitude tests covers few questions on numbers, reasoning and probability.
Technical part covers Operating System, Database and Data Structures
Coding Questions
1. Given a sorted array, print any two numbers equal to a given number.
2. Write optimized code to find x to the power of y.
3. Given an array of n numbers, divide the array in 3 Lots in such a way that the difference between the lots is minimum (I gave sort the array and then divide into lots by taking elements from each list for e.g. 1,2,3|4,5,6|7,8,9  take them like (1,6,7),(2,5,8),(3,6,9)).
4. Write a program to print the matrix in alternating rectangle of 0’s and X’s.
5. Write a program for searching for number of occurrences of a word in file.
