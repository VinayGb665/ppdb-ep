Given an array arr[] of n integers, construct a Product Array prod[] (of same size) such that prod[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of arr[] except arr[i]. Solve it without division operator and in O(n).
Example:

We have already discussed O(n) approach in A product array puzzle | set 1. The previous approach uses extra O(n) space for constructing product array.
In this post, a better approach has been discussed which uses log property to find the product of all elements of array except at particular index. This approach uses no extra space.
Use property of log to multiply large numbers
x = a * b * c * d
log(x) = log(a * b * c * d)
log(x) = log(a) + log(b) + log(c) + log(d)
x = antilog(log(a) + log(b) + log(c) + log(d))
