TI :
The interview started with “Introduce yourself” followed by “what do you know about Qualcomm?”Then he gone through my resume and started asking questions on each coursework. Since I am from Visual Information Processing and Embedded Systems background they asked some basic questions like:
What are the different types of image transforms? Why they are required ? What is DCT ? Why DCT is used for compression? What is the need of compression ?
What are the different resolutions available for video files ? What is the need of video compression? Architecture of video encoder/decoder ?
What are the different storage classes available in C ? what is static variable ? Where you can use it ?What is the difference between pointer and reference ? Write a code to swap two numbers ? Write a code to find prime numbers in given range?
What is the difference between semaphore and mutex ? What is spinlock ? What is thread ? What is paging ? What is virtual memory ? Can we have an infinite amount of virtual memory ?
This followed by detailed discussion of each project and internship.Since my project was in Device to device communication and Qualcomm works in that area the rest of the interview was centered around my project only.
HR:
Why Qualcomm ? What is your M Tech project ?
What are your weaknesses ? Hobbies ? Any higher education plans ? Family background ?
Along with all skill sets they look for good CGPA as well.
Overall it was good experience.
