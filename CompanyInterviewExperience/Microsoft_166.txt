Microsoft Visited our campus  for Internship selections on IDC and IT profile. There were three rounds for the selection process of IDC profile
First Round :Coding round
3 Questions were asked in different sets . Out of which people who solved 2 and more are shortlisted . People who solved 3 were shortlisted for Personal Interview , while the one’s who solved 2 were shortlisted for Group fly round.
Questions were :
Apparently , I was shortlisted for Personal Interview , so I didn’t attend the Group Fly round.
3rd Round( HR round)
The manager was very very cool and asked me questions like . Why do you want to join microsoft? Why should we hire you and related stuff about me and he asked me to solve this question. Find the majority Element (element that repeats more than (N/2) times in an array . If it doesn’t exist , return -1. I told him the way to solve it in O(N) time and O(1) space using Moore’s voting algorithm And after these rounds , I was given offer for the Internship for IDC profile.
Though I was selected for GolmanSachs Interview too , I had to take up this offer and I didn’t sit for GS personal Interview.
Thanks to GeeksforGeeks for helping me revise all the concepts and practice them with the help of practice.geeksforgeeks.org . My Last 15 days before the Intern were completely spent solving problems and revising them in GeeksforGeeks.
