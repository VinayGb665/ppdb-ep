You are given an array of positive and/or negative integers and a value K . The task is to find count of all sub-arrays whose sum is divisible by K?
Examples :

A simple solution for this problem is to one by one calculate sum of all sub-arrays possible and check divisible by K. The time complexity for this approach will be O(n^2).
An efficient solution is based on below observation.
So if any sub-array sum from index i’th to j’th  is divisible by k then we can saya[0]+…a[i-1] (mod k) = a[0]+…+a[j] (mod k)
The above explanation is provided by Ekta Goel.
So we need to find such a pair of indices (i, j) that they satisfy the above condition. Here is the algorithm :
