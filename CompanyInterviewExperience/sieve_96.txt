Given a number n, count total number of divisors of n!.
Examples:
A Simple Solution is to first compute factorial of given number, then count number divisors of the factorial. This solution is not efficient and may cause overflow due to factorial computation.
A better solution is based on Legendreâ€™s formula . Below are the steps.
Below is C++ implementation of above idea.
