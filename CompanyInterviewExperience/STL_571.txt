The introduction of array class from C++11 has offered a better alternative for C-style arrays. The advantages of array class over C-style array are :-
 
Operations on array :-
1. at() :- This function is used to access the elements of array.
2. get() :- This function is also used to access the elements of array. This function is not the member of array class but overloaded function from class tuple.
3. operator[] :- This is similar to C-style arrays. This method is also used to access array elements.

Output:
 
4. front() :- This returns the first element of array.
5. back() :- This returns the last element of array.

Output:
6. size() :- It returns the number of elements in array. This is a property that C-style arrays lack.
7. max_size() :- It returns the maximum number of elements array can hold i.e, the size with which array is declared. The size() and max_size() return the same value.

Output:
8. swap() :- The swap() swaps all elements of one array with other.

Output:
 
9. empty() :- This function returns true when the array size is zero else returns false.
10. fill() :- This function is used to fill the entire array with a particular value.
