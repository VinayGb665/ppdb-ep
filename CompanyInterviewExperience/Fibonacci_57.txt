Given a range, count Fibonacci numbers in given range. First few Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 141, ..

A Brute Force Solution is to one by one find all Fibonacci Numbers and count all Fibonacci numbers in given range
An Efficient Solution is to use previous Fibonacci Number to generate next using simple Fibonacci formula that fn = fn-1 + fn-2.

Time Complexity Analysis:
Consider the that Fibonacci Numbers can be written as below


So the value of Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially. It means that the  while loop grows exponentially till it reaches ‘high’. So the loop runs O(Log (high)) times. 
One solution could be directly use above formula to find count of Fibonacci Numbers, but that is not practically feasible (See this for details).
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
