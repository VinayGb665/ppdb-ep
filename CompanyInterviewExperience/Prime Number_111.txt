A Right-truncatable prime is a prime which remains prime when the last (“right”) digit is successively removed. For example, 239 is right-truncatable prime since 239, 23 and 2 are all prime. There are 83 right-truncatable primes.
The task is to check whether the given number (N > 0) is right-truncatable prime or not. 
Examples:

The idea is to generate all the primes less than or equal to the given number N using Sieve of Eratosthenes. Once we have generated all such primes, then we check whether the number remains prime when the last (“right”) digit is successively removed.
