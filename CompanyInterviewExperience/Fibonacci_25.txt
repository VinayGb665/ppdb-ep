Given the upper limit limit, print factorials of all Fibonacci Numbers smaller than limit.
Examples :

We know simple factorial computations cause overflow very soon. Therefore we use factorials of large numbers. 
One simple solution is to generate all Fibonacci numbers one by one and compute factorial of every generated number using method discussed in factorials of large numbers
An efficient solution is based on the fact that Fibonacci numbers are increasing order.  So we use previously generated factorial to compute next factorial.
