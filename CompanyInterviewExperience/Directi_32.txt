Recently DirectI visited our campus for placements for three profiles –
	1. Platform Engineer
	2. Applications Engineer
	3. Operations Engineer
This process is for the first two profiles, I did not apply for Operations.
Round 1: Online coding round (263 applicants)
Q1. Given cost C[i] and calorie content P[i] of n chocolates, find the maximum amount of calorie one can take in a budget of W money units. Constraints : W <= 1000, n <=100, C[i]<=100, P[i] <= 100.
Q2. Given 2 strings s and p of same length. (length<=16)
	Define dist(string a, string b) = max(distinct characters in a, distinct characters in b).
	A valid operation is to exchange characters at the same index between s and p. Eg: if s=”abaa” and p=”baab”, then after one operation, we can get s=”aaaa” and p=”bbab” (Exchanging characters at index 1).
	Find the minimum value of dist(s,p) if s and p can undergo the described operation any number of times.
Q3. Given a tree with n nodes in the following manner – In array par, par[i] denotes parent of node i in the tree. Root is always at index 1 and par[1]=0. Also, index of child nodes is always greater than index of parent.
	Given q queries, process each of them ->
	a) ADD(x,y) : Add value y to node x.
	b) ADDUP(x,y) : Add value y to all nodes in the path from root to node x.
	c) VAL(x) : Print value of node x.
	d) VALTREE(x) : Print sum of values of all nodes in the subtree with root x.
	Constraints: 1<=n<=1,000,000
				1<=q<=1,000,000
	Those who solved at least two questions were shortlisted.
Round 2: F2F Algo round 1(31 shortlisted candidates)
Consisted of only 1 algorithm based question, so did the next two rounds. Had to write the code.
Q. Given an nxn chessboard and position (x,y) of a knight on it, what is the probability that it stays in the chessboard after k moves.
Round 3: F2F Algo round 2 (20 shortlisted candidates)
Only approach was asked.
Q. Points from (0,0) to (R,C) in the cartesian plane are colored r, g or b. Make a triangle using these points such that-
	a) All three vertices are of different colors.
	b) At least one side of triangle is parallel to either of the axes.
	c) Area of the triangle is maximum possible.
	Output the maximum possible area.
	Constraints : 1<=R<=1000, 1<=C<=1000
	9 people were directly shortlisted for final interview, and 4 were immediately rejected. Rest 7 were called for Algo round 3.
Round 4 : F2F Algo round 3 (7 candidates)
	Given heights of n rows of grass H[n]. A farmer does the following operation k times->
	Selects start index (s), end index (e) and a height (h). Fixes his grass trimming instrument at height h and trims the grass from row-s to row-e. Meaning, for each H[i] for i between s and e, H[i]=min(H[i],h).
	Print all heights after k operations.
	Attention -> If H[i] was 6 and h was 4, then after trimming H[i] becomes 4 (does not reduce by 4).
	Prohibited ->
	a) O(nk) solution.
	b) Use of Segment Tree(Only Update operations are there, so Segment Tree is overkill).
	c) Use of BIT.
	Expected time complexity – O(nlogn).
	I gave all these approaches before the interviewer rejected them, then gave an approach using heaps with time complexity O(nlogn), but he wanted a simpler approach.
	Only 1 candidate from these 7 was called for final interview (in addition to the 9 previously selected). I was rejected in this round.
Final Interview : Telephonic(over Skype, 10 candidates)
	I didn’t give this round but here’s what they asked-
	1. Introduction about yourself.
	2. Projects done, past internships.
	3. Questions related to DS (around 6-7).
	4. Questions related to networking (around 10-12).
	5. Questions related to DBMS and OS (around 10-12).
	6. Few HR questions.
	Finally, 4 candidates were selected, 3 as Platform Engineers and 1 as Applications Engineer.
