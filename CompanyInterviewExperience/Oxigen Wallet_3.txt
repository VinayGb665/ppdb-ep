 Q2.linked list multiplication: Given two linked list that represents polynomial
return a pointer to linked list which is multiplication of the two. 

Second Round:(F2F interview)
Project related questions
oops concepts in detail.
Linked list what are its advantages.
and some basic general questions on  data structures.

Third Round:(With the CTO)
He asked oops concepts
