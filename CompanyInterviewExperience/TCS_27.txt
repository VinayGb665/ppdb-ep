Solution – Sample E-mail:

Dear Mr Roy,
The project “Payment Processing System” which was scheduled to be completed by 10th May (Friday) will face a delay.  Due to an unexpected power outage at the site for the past 3 days and failing to get the backups online, an overall delay is imminent. Therefore a maximum of 7 days would be required to come up with an overhaul which includes recovery of lost work and resuming the task. 
We would like to apologize for the delay caused and would ensure that the failure will not recur in the future again.
Thanks and regards,
Chinmoy.
