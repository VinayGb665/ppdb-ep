Given a number and to find first and last digit of a number.
Examples:

To find last digit of a number, we use modulo operator %. When modulo divided by 10 returns its last digit.
Suppose if n = 1234
then last Digit = n % 10 => 4
To finding first digit of a number is little expensive than last digit. To find first digit of a number we divide the given number by 10 until number is greater than 10. At the end we are left with the first digit.
