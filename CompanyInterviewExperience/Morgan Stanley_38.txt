3 questions coding + 30 objective
Total Time – 1:30 hr
Objective Ques were simple – C/C++ prog, , input/output, logical ques.
Coding Ques —
1. Given an array and a number k. Find number of pairs in the array having sum equal to k.
2. Given a number N. We can divide the number into N/2,N/3 and N/4 at a time rounding all these to integer value. Now you can repeat above procedure for newly generated numbers.
Get the maximum number that you can generate from a given number.
Example – Given Number = 12
12 –> 6 + 4 + 3
6 –> 3 + 2 + 1
4 –> 2 + 1 + 1
3 – > 1 + 1 + 0
So max number generated = 13 (6+4+3).
3. Various dates are given to us in a specific format. Find the least date among them.
