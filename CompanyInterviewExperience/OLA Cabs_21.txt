I attended interview for Ola high availability team. Below are the questions.
1) Find k distant nodes in given tree. The paths going through parent should also be printed.
2) Find the first non repeating character in given string.
3) Give design for leader board implementation. 1000 customers with maximum points should be displayed on the leader dashboard. UI should handle real time changes. A customerâ€™s points are updated after each ride/order.
