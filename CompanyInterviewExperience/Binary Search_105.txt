Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer k, the task is to find the maximum subarray size such that all subarrays of that size have sum of elements less than k.
Examples :

First of all, required subarray size must lie between 1 to n.
Now, since all the array element are positive integers, we can say that the prefix sum of any subarray shall be strictly increasing.
Thus, we can say that 
So, we perform   Binary Search over the range 1 to n and find the highest subarray size such that all the subarrays of that size have sum of elements less than k.
Below is implementation of this approach.
