Valarray slice selector : This class represents a valarray slice selector. It does not contain nor refers to any element – it only describes a selection of elements to be used as an index in valarray::operator[].
std::slice is the selector class that identifies a subset of std::valarray. An object of type std::slice holds three values: the starting index, the stride, and the total number of values in the subset. Objects of type std::slice can be used as indexes with valarray’s operator[]. 
In simple terms it is used to slice based on an index. A valarray slice is defined by a starting index, a size, and a stride.
Syntax :
Example: 
Therefore, a slice with a stride higher than 1 does not select contiguous elements in the valarray.  For example, slice(3, 4, 5) selects the elements 3, 8, 13 and 18.
