A cube free number  square free number whose none of any divisor is a cubic number (a number which is cube of an integer). Given an integer n, find all cube free numbers smaller than or equal to n.
Examples :
A simple solution is to traverse through all numbers from 1 to n. For every number check if it is cube free or not. If yes, then print it.

An efficient solution is to use Sieve of Eratosthenes like technique, to wash out the non cube free numbers. Here we will create  boolean sieve array and initialize it with true values. Now we will start iterating a variable ‘div’ from 2, and start marking multiples of cube of div as false as those will be the non cube free numbers. Then after this the elements left with value true will be the cube free numbers.
