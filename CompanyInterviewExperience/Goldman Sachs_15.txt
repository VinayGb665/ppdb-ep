Internship Role: Summer Analyst
Hi Iâ€™m Bharat Reddy from NIT-Calicut. It was the last week of July that we heard that GS will be coming to take interns from NIT-C. The entire selection process consisted of 3 rounds, an online preliminary round, followed by 2 rounds of interviews.
Online Preliminary Round
Given a 2D plane and 2 points on it named AÂ and B.Along with them we are also given a set of n points P1, P2, P3, â€¦..Pn. With AÂ and BÂ as centres we can draw 2 circles of radii R1Â and R2 respectively. Now we are asked to calculate the values of R1Â and R2Â such that all NÂ points P1, P2, P3, â€¦..PnÂ lie inside at leastÂ one of the 2 circles, and the value ofR12 + R22 is minimum.
Around 600+ students gave the test(since there was no restriction on CGPAÂ and Branch). The next day results were announced and 17 students were shortlisted for interviews which were scheduled to be held the following day.
Interview Rounds
There were 2 interview rounds, both of them were face to face interviews with engineers at GS.
First Round
In fact all these questions were discussed during the end of FOP(Foundations of Programming Course), so big thanks to our sir ðŸ™‚
I was then asked about my Internship experience at IIT-Bombay, which I attended during summers after 2nd year.We had a nice little chat on the project which I worked on during my Internship, and about the technologies used in it.
That was the end of first round and 5 students were qualified for second round.
Second Round
Then he gave a real life situation and asked me to give a solution to it.
That was the end of Interviews. We got results on the same day and 3 of us made it through, and Iâ€™m one of them ðŸ˜€
I would like to take this opportunity and thank Geeks for Geeks, it wouldnâ€™t have been possible without it. 
I hope my experiences help you to be better prepared for your Internship Opportunities.
All the Best !
