(Not the first repeated character, found here.)

Simple Solution using O(N^2) complexity
The solution is to loop through the string for each character and search for the same in the rest of the string. This would need two loops and thus not optimal.

Output:
Optimization by counting occurrences
This solution is optimized by using the following techniques:
1. We loop through the string and hash the characters using ASCII codes. Store 1 if found and store 2 if found again. Also, store the position of the letter first found in.
2. We run a loop on the hash array and now we find the minimum position of any character repeated.
This will have a runtime of O(N).
