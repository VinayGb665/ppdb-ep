Given an positive even integer ‘n’. Count total number of ways to express ‘n’ as sum of even positive integers. Output the answer in modulo 109 + 7
Examples:
Approach is to find pattern or recursive function whichever is possible. The approach would be the same as already discussed in “Count ways to express ‘n’ as sum of odd integers“. Here the given number is even that means even sum can only be achieved by adding the (n-2)th number as two times. We can notice that (by taking some examples) adding a 2 to a number doubles the count.  Let the total number of ways to write ‘n’ be ways(n). The value of ‘ways(n)’ can be written by formula as follows:
