First Round
1. There were 5 Programming Questions and the test was conducted on HackerRank.
2. I solved 3 out of them.
Mostly the questions consisted of all levels from easy to tough mostly on Dynamic Programming.
After 1 week I got a mail saying that i cleared the first round.
Second Round : 
1. It was an Online Technical Interview at Hacker Rank.
2. 2 coding questions were asked:
           a) Find total number of  unique palindromic sub sequences from a string.
           b) Find if a number is  a power of 2 or not. 
3. Then a designing and database question was asked. He wanted to know how well are you able to design tables and establish relationships between them.
4. Then he asked me some front end related questions as I was working as an intern on front end development at a company.
The interview lasted about 2 hours.
Overall it was a very good experience. They test you from every aspect. In the End I would like to say that Practo is one of the best companies to work for.
Thanks Geeks for Geeks for providing a platform to prepare for such stuff. Thanks
