Given a string, find the smallest window length with all distinct characters of the given string. For eg. str = “aabcbcdbca”, then the result would be 4 as of the smallest window will be “dbca” .
Examples:
Above problem states that we have to find the smallest window that contains all the distinct characters of the given string even if the smallest string contains repeating elements.
For example, in “aabcbcdb”, the smallest string that contains all the characters is “abcbcd”.
This problem reduces to  Find the smallest window in a string containing all characters of another string.
In that problem we find the smallest window that contains all the characters of given pattern.
1-  Count all distinct characters in given string.
2-  Now follow the algorithm discussed in below post.

We basically maintain a window of characters. Whenever the window contains all characters of given string, we shrink the window from left side to remove extra characters and then compare its length with smallest window fount so far.
