Each day, Microsoft search engine bing posts some informative image. How will you ensure each day image is different from the beginning of posting? ( Note the word – informative). —–> Do not distinguish on basis of color, texture, background etc. Think in terms of text. Even if orientation is different but text is same then image is same. Don’t think for RGB value either.
