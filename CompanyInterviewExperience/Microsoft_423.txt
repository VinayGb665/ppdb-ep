Mirror of a Tree: Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.


Trees in the above figure are mirror of each other

Method 1 (Recursive)

Algorithm – Mirror(tree):
Run on IDE
Run on IDE

Time & Space Complexities:  This program is similar to traversal of tree space and time complexities will be same as Tree traversal (Please see our Tree Traversal post for details)
 

Method 2 (Iterative)

The idea is to do queue based level order traversal.  While doing traversal, swap left and right children of every node.
