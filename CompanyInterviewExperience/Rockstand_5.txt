Given a directed graph, check whether the graph contains a cycle or not.  Your function should return true if the given graph contains at least one cycle, else return false.  For example, the following graph contains three cycles 0->2->0,  0->1->2->0 and  3->3, so your function must return true.
Depth First Traversal can be used to detect a cycle in a Graph. DFS for a connected graph produces a tree. There is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge present in the graph. A back edge is an edge that is from a node to itself (self-loop) or one of its ancestor in the tree produced by DFS. In the following graph, there are 3 back edges, marked with a cross sign. We can observe that these 3 back edges indicate 3 cycles present in the graph.

For a disconnected graph, we get the DFS forest as output. To detect cycle, we can check for a cycle in individual trees by checking back edges.
To detect a back edge, we can keep track of vertices currently in recursion stack of function for DFS traversal.  If we reach a vertex that is already in the recursion stack, then there is a cycle in the tree. The edge that connects current vertex to the vertex in the recursion stack is a back edge.  We have used recStack[] array to keep track of vertices in the recursion stack.

Time Complexity of this method is same as time complexity of DFS traversal which is O(V+E).

In the below article, another O(V + E) method is discussed :
