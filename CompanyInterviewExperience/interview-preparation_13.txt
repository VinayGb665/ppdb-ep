This is a model placement paper for aptitude preparation of Cognizant Technology Solutions Interview. This placement paper will cover aptitude questions that are asked in CTS recruitment drives and also strictly follows the pattern of questions asked in CTS interviews. It is recommended to solve each one of the following questions to increase your chances of clearing the CTS interview.
Solution:
We know that 100! = 100 * 99 * 98 * … * 23 * 22 * 21 * … * 3 * 2 * 1
So when this equation is divided by 23, the remainder is 0.
Solution:
Let us assume that the slower pipe can fill the bucket in x minutes.
So the faster tap can feel the bucket in x/3 minutes.
According to the question,
Therefore,
1/x + x/3 = 1/36
=> x = 144 minutes.
Solution:
So Aman’s rate in still water = (15 – 2.5) = 12.5 km/hr.
and Aman’s rate against the current = (12.5 – 2.5) km/hr = 10 km/hr.
Solution:
Let the ratios of division be = 5x:7x:8x
There is an increase of 40%, 50% and 75% respectively.
Therefore, applying the % over the ratio we get, 7x:21x/2:14x
So, this is the required ratio.
= 14x : 21x: 28x
= 2 : 3 : 4
Solution:
Given the external diameter = 8 cm. Therefore, the radius = 4 cm.
The thickness = 1 cm. Therefore the internal radius = 4 – 1 = 3 cm
The volume of the iron = pi * (R^2 – r^2) * length
= 22/7 * [(4^2) – (3^2)] * 21 cubic-cm
= 462 cubic-cm
Therefore, the weight of iron = 462 * 8 gm = 3.696 kg
Solution:
Let Rohit present age be x years
Therefore father’s age is x + 3x = 4x years
According to the question,
4x + 8 = 5/2(x + 8)
=> 3x = 24
=> x = 8
So the answer is: (4x + 16) / (x + 16) = 48/24 = 2
Solution:
Time is taken by one tap to fill half the bucket = 3 hours
So the part filled 4 taps in one hour = 4 * (1/6) = 2/3 of the bucket.
Therefore, the remaining part is = (1 – 1/2) = 1/2
Proportinally = 2/3 : 1/2 :: 1 : x
=> x = 3/4 hours = 45 minutes. So the total time = 3 hrs 45 minutes.
Solution:
Let the speed of the stream be x km/hr.
Therfore the, speed of downstream = (15 + x) km/hr,
and speed of upstream = (15 – x) km/hr.
According to the question,
30/(15 + x) + 30/(15 – x) = 9/2
or, 900/(225 – x^2)    = 9/2
or, 9x^2 = 225
or, x^2 = 25
or, x = 5 km/hr.
Solution:
From the given ratio we can deduce the quantity of milk as = 60 * (2/3) = 40 lit
and the quantity of water = 60 – 40 = 20 lit
The new ratio must be 1:2
Let the quantity of water to be added be x lit.
Then milk:water = 40 / (20 + x)
This should be equal to = 1/2
=> 20 + x = 80
or, x = 60
Solution:
According to the question,
2(15 + 12)*h = 2(15 * 12)
=> h = (180/27) = 20/3 meter
Therefore, the volume = l * b * h = (15 * 12 * 20/3) cubic-meter = 1200 (answer)
