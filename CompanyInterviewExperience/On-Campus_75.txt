Round 1: (Aptitude Test)
The first round was the Aptitude Test. There were 14 MCQ questions and one coding question. The duration of the test was 1 hour.
The MCQ’s were based on general aptitude, data structure and SQL. The coding question was a quite basic one which was to count the number of small case alphabets, upper case alphabets, numbers and special symbols in the given sentence (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-check-input-character-alphabet-digit-special-character/)
The time limit is more than sufficient to solve the questions. 320 students appeared for the test out of which 43 students were shortlisted for the second round.
