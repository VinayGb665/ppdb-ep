In STL, containers can change size dynamically.  Allocator is an object that is responsible for dynamic memory allocation/deallocation.  get_allocator() is used to allocate memory chunks of memory. It returns a copy of the allocator object associated with the container.  It is defined in vector, map, list, set libraries.
Syntax:
Parameter Used:  
This member function does not need any parameter to be passed.
Return Type: 
It returns a copy of the allocator object associated with the vector.
Errors and Exceptions:
Never throws exceptions so we don’t need any try-catch surrounding of it.
Time-Complexity: 
Constant O(1).
