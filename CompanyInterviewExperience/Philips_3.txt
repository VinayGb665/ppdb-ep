Round 1: Resume-based shortlisting
Phillips Innovation Campus, Bangalore contacted our college to hire Summer Interns for 2 months, starting May 2018. The first round was shortlisting based on resumes. Mostly people who had done projects in Machine Learning and NLP were shortlisted as most of their projects are in this area only. One student whose projects were from the field of augmented virtual reality was also shortlisted.
Overall they shortlisted 6 Btech and 5 Mtech students for the next round.
I would recommend that if you have done projects in Machine learning then you should highlight those in your resume when applying for Philips.
Round 2: Telephonic Interview
A panel of 3 people took the telephonic interview.
First, they asked about my projects and what all techniques I had used. I had done two projects in ML. One was an article recommendation system and another used Sentiment Analysis to judge a brandâ€™s online presence based on reviews on twitter, fb etc.Â  Then they asked me questions on Machine Learning based on the concepts that had been used in the projects:
Then he asked some general Machine Learning questions :
Finally, he asked two programming questions:
I was able to answer most of the questions up to mark and he seemed pretty impressed.
I would recommend havingÂ in-depthÂ knowledge of the Machine Learning techniques you have used in your projects and revise basic DSA.Â 
Overall the interviewÂ went on for about 25 minutes. They shortlisted 4 Btech and 1 MTech students and I was one of them!
Looking forward to working with them ðŸ™‚
