VMWare visited our campus to recruit freshers to offer 6 months internship + full time employment for the positions of Application Developer / Member of Technical Staff. The whole process consisted of 5 OR 6 rounds, 1 online test and 3 rounds of interviews. The eligibility criteria was CSE/IT with a minimum GPA criteria of 7.0/10.
Finally 3 students were offered internship + FTE. Unfortunately I wasnâ€™t one of them.
