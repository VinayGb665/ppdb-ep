Given a range [low..high], print the largest twin numbers in given range (low and high inclusive). Two numbers are twins if they are primes and there difference is 2.
Examples:
A Simple Solution is to start from high and for every number x check if x and x â€“ 2 are primes are not. Here x varies from high to low + 2.
An Efficient Solution is to use Sieve of Eratosthenes:
