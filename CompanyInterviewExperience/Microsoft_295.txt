Difficulty Level: Rookie
Given a number n and a value k, turn of the k’th bit in n. 
Examples:
The idea is to use bitwise <<, & and ~ operators.  Using expression "~(1 << (k – 1))“,  we get a number which has all bits set, except the k’th bit.  If we do bitwise & of this expression with n, we get a number which has all bits same as n except the k’th bit which is 0.  
Below is the implementation of above idea.
