Solution â€“ Sample E-mail:

Dear Mr Kumar,
I am a resident of Ashok Vihar and would like to bring to your notice about the P/T constructions company who are building a construction for a very long time. The work has been going for three years and hardly made any progress. There has been reckless water usage since the years. The water spill all over the locality along with the constructing debris, forming a breeding ground for mosquitoes. The place is starting to turn unhygienic by the pigs, mosquitoes and construction waste. We tried to get in touch with the construction workers but there bad behaviour with the locals is raising another issue.
It would be great if you could pay your attention to this problem and request you to take action to resolve this problem immediately.
Thanks and regards,
Arvind.
