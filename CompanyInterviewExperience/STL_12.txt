bit_and is a builtin function in C++ which is used to return the values after applying the bitwise_and on its arguments(as returned by operator &).
T is the type of all the arguments.
Note:
We must include the library ‘functional’ and ‘algorithm’ to use bit_and and transform respectively otherwise they will not work.
