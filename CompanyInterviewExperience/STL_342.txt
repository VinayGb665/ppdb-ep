Given a priority queue of integers, find the number of prime and non prime numbers.
Algorithm
1. Enter the size of the priority queue into a variable.
2. Check if the priority queue is empty, check if the top element is prime, if prime increments the prime counter, and pop the top element.
3. Repeat this step until the priority queue is empty.
4. Print the final value of the variable prime and nonprime(size â€“ prime).
