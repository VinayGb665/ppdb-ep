Recently I was interviewed for Amazon SDE II for Amazon Pay Team. Below are the Questions :
.
.
Round 1 : (Written : Pen & Paper) (3 Questions)
Q1) Given a 1D Array. Return True if there exists an element where a[i]+a[j] = 0 && i!=j.
Reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-pair-with-the-given-difference/
Input : arr = {2,-3,4,1,-6,-4,1}
Output : True
Input : arr = {2,3,4,1,-6,4,1}
Output : False
Q2) Related to Buy and Sell of stock and gain maximum profit. Only 1 unit to buy or sell at a time.
Reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stock-buy-sell/
Q3) Given a Tree (it was a BST), replace the data of all nodes which have data >= the node’s data.
Exactly Same problem : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/add-greater-values-every-node-given-bst/
(Even the example was same from above link ;))
.

Round 2 : DS and Algo (F2F) (3 Questions)
Q1) Program for n’th node from the end of a Linked List
Exactly Same problem : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nth-node-from-the-end-of-a-linked-list/
Q2) Print min & max (both) of all subarray of size k
Reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sliding-window-maximum-maximum-of-all-subarrays-of-size-k/
Note : The reference link is just for min or max. Here we need both min and max in one program.
Q3) Find the k most frequent words from a file (or a stream of input)
Exactly Same problem : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-k-most-frequent-words-from-a-file/
.
.
Result : I was eliminated due to some basic mistakes I did (in Q3), which I just realized after leaving the Interview room. It was a nice experience.
.
.
I would also like to share few more Questions those were asked to other candidates over there : 
Q1) Design Debugger (Asked to almost everyone in 2nd Round)
Q2) Design Uber App
Q3) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-nodes-distance-k-given-node-binary-tree/
Q4) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/connect-nodes-at-same-level/
Q5) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-of-jumps-to-reach-end-of-a-given-array/
.
.
The Interviewers were very friendly and helpful. They will help you whenever you get stuck (with Hints), but they will also check how much grab you have on basics.

Thank You!!!… Hope this will help the aspiring candidates.
