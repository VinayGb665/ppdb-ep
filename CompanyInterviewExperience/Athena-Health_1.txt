Round 1:
10 Aptitude questions with difficulty level hard. 
Round 2:
3 programs given. 1st one mandatory.
1) Replace wild cards with all possible combinations of zeros and ones. 
2) Triplet problem.
        Array = {2,3,7,6,8,9} and k=6.
            {2,3,6} (2×3 = 6)
            {3,2,6} (3×2 = 6)
3) Another one dynamic programming problem. I couldn’t remember.
Round 3(F2F): 
Questions about previous projects done and my roles on it and my leadership capabilities.
Few technical questions from Threads and multi-processing and.
Discussed about triplet problem done in round 2 and how to tweak my algorithm to avoid getting redundant entries.
Search in row wise, column wise sorted matrix 
Round 4(F2F):
Level order traversal of a tree and discussed about time and space complexity of both techniques(Using Queue and recursive technique)

Array of 0’s and 1’s. Move 0’s to left and 1’s to right side.

Given an array of integers, replace every element with the next greatest element (greatest element on the right side) in the array.  {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2} = {17, 5, 5, 5, 2, -1}

Difference between Tree and Trie data structure along with implementation of Trie and real time examples.
Questions on data structure for implementing dictionary and its pros and cons.
Questions on implementation of Linux directory structure.
Discussed about logic I used in 2nd round for wild card permutation question and discussed time complexity of it.
Round 5(F2F):
Given 3 points in below triangle, find wheather these 3 points are forming equalaterial triangle? 
Questions about previous projects and current one.
Why Athena and shifting from old company in short period?
Aptitude problems from first round and how i understood and approached towards solution
Deep discussion about 8 queens problem and its solution(I used backtracking approach)
Round 6(F2F):
Turing machine problems.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine_examples)
1. There is a sequence of bytes coming. after every instance I need to check wheather that number can be devisible by 3 or not.     Need turing machine diagram and approach.
2. Similar turing machine question for prime number.
Tree level order and spiral order traversal and its complexity analysis.
Questions on array split to two halves of equal sum.
Round 7(HR):
Behavioral questions and team skills.
