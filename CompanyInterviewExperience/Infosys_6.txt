My first question was tell me about yourself. I have mention two projects in my cv so there was some discussion on my project. Then he asked the sql query i.e to select top 3 rows from a student table arranged in descending order. he asked normalization question also. a table was given and I have to tell the table is in which nf. then the difference between 2nf and 3nf. then he asked me software development life cycle.
Out of all these questions, I was not able to answer the sql query and the software development life cycle properly. Then he saw my certificates and said ” thank you, any questions”
Though this was my first interview experience. I was able to clear it. They select 142 out of which I was one of them.
