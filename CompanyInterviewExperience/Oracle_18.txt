Round 1 : They use their own Platform to conduct the first round.
This was approximately 2 hour test with the following sections :
Most of the questions in the test were hard and I wouldn’t have been able to solve them but luckily I can across a site called PrepInsta and a good percentage of the questions were repeated from it. I will suggest to focus more on this round as there is no point preparing for the interview if you don’t clear the written test round.
Round 2 :
My interviewer was extremely sweet. He told me that he was going to ask the same questions that were asked to him during his placement :
Round 3 :
Question: 
Both the candidates were given time to write their codes(not pseudo code) on a sheet of paper and then were asked to submit the sheet. Then called in turns for the interview on the code.
37 candidates qualified after this round.
