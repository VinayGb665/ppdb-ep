Given an array with N elements, task is to find the count of factors of a number X which is product of all array elements.
Examples:
 Method 1 (Simple but causes overflow) 
1. Multiply all the elements of the array.
2. Count divisors in the number obtained after multiplication.

Method 2 (Avoids overflow)
1. Find maximum element in array
1. Find prime numbers smaller than the maximum element
3. Find the number of overall occurrences of each prime factor in whole array by traversing all array elements and finding their prime factors. We use hashing to count occurrences.
4. Let the counts of occurrences of prime factors be a1, a2, …aK, if we have K distinct prime factors, then the answer will be: (a1+1)(a2+1)(…)*(aK+1).
