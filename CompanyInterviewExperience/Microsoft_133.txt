Given two sorted arrays, the task is to merge them in a sorted manner.
Examples:

Method 1 (O(n1 * n2) Time and O(1) Extra Space) 
We have discussed implementation of above method in Merge two sorted arrays with O(1) extra space
Method 2 (O(n1 + n2) Time and O(n1 + n2) Extra Space)
The idea is to use Merge function of Merge sort.
