It was an offÂ­-campus drive. More than 1000 people appeared for the drive. 
ROUND 1: 
 This round had 15 aptitude questions which were easy. The hint is you have to think logically
and apply basic maths. And also 10  C output questions which were tough.
Only 15% of people survived for programming round.
Those who didnâ€™t clear first round went for Content Writing role. 
ROUND 2:
This round had 5 easy programming questions. 
1) Given an array, find the minimum of all the greater numbers for each element in the
array.  
2)   Find the largest sum contiguous subarray which should not have negative numbers.         We have to print the sum and the corresponding array elements which brought up the
sum. 
   3)  Given a string, we have to reverse the string without changing the position of punctuations and spaces. 
   4)  Given a 2D grid of characters, you have to search for all the words in a dictionary by
moving only along two directions, either right or down.  Print the word if it occurs. 
   5)  Given a string, change the order of words in the string (last string should come first).
Should use RECURSION 
Should solve atleast 3 problemsâ€¦â€¦Around 30 students cleared this round. 
ROUND 3: 
This was an application development round.  The application was TOLL PAYMENT PROCESSING .
They insisted us to do it in a object oriented language.  First they asked the design( what are all the classes and objects & what data structure do you use). 
Application description: 
There were 4 modules. 
1. Given the details of vehicle type, start and destinationâ€¦â€¦display the total toll paid during
the journey and print the amount after applying the discount. 
2. Display the details of all the tollsâ€¦..like what are all the vehicles(vehicle number) passed
that respective toll and the amount each vehicle paidâ€¦â€¦and the total amount charged in
that toll.

the tolls between that route and calculate the amount. 
After this round , only 7 students survived for the next round.

How will you query to get all people details from aadhar databaseâ€¦.what are all the
challenges? 
And some queries on JOINS. 
Asked me to solve some first round aptitude questionsâ€¦â€¦and asked me about the previous
