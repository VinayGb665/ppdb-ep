Slight change is 1, 0 is there in the matrix. 0 means no path and 1 means path.
Question 2 :- Count the number of the cavity in the 2d matrix and mark it to X, a cavity is defined as all the surrounding number are greater than the mid number.
For e.g.  4 5 6
          7 1 5
          4 5 6 here 1 is the cavity.
