Given a tree of N nodes and N-1 edges. Also given an integer M and a node, the task is to print the M-th node in the DFS of the subtree of a given node for multiple queries. 
Note: M will not be greater than the number of nodes in the subtree of the given node.


Input: M = 3, node = 1
Output: 4
In the above example if 1 is given as the node, then the DFS of subtree will be 1 2 4 6 7 5 3, hence if M is 3, then the 3rd node is 4 
Input: M = 4, node = 2
Output: 7
If 2 is given as the node, then the DFS of the subtree will be 2 4 6 7 5., hence if M is 4 then the 4th node is 7.
Approach:  
 Below is the implementation of the above approach.

Time Complexity: O(1), for processing each query.
Auxiliary Space: O(N)
