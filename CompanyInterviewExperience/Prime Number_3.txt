Given a positive integer . The task is to write a C program to check if the number is prime or not. 
Definition:
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}
The idea to solve this problem is to iterate through all the numbers starting from 2 to (N/2) using a for loop and for every number check if it divides N. If we find any number that divides, we return false. If we did not find any number between 2 and N/2 which divides N then it means that N is prime and we will return True.
Below is the C program to check if a number is prime:
