Online Test: The first round was an online test. There were no coding questions. There were MCQs based on computer networks, Databases, OS, OOPS concepts etc.
Interview: Students shortlisted from the online test were called for interview. There were 3 rounds of interview:
Round 1: The interviewer of the first round was in a bit hurry. I was asked only one question:Â /https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/. I was asked to code it too.
Round 2: The interviewer here was more patient and asked about my projects. Then he asked me a puzzle. He asked me how to prove (a+b)^2Â  = a^2 + b^2 +2ab without mathematically. He provided me with a square sheet. I proved it geometrically (link here: https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i1enQcj5pl4/maxresdefault.jpg). He seemed satisfied and sent me for round 3.
Round 3: This was the HR round. He asked me about a hackathon, in which my team came as runner up, in detail. He also asked about my understanding in cloud technology as it came up somewhere during our talk.
Experience: It was mostly negative.Â It seemed like they were not taking this process seriously. The interviewer of the first round first asked me the most celebrated question of the interviews: â€˜So, tell me about yourself?â€™ and I had barely spoken 10 words when he interrupted me to ask that searching question. And then he just burst away and came like 10 minutes after( havenâ€™t seen any interviewer doing like this before!). And I was already late for some other interview as the companies are given slots of an hour. When I told him this, he said that if I stay, then he would â€˜finalise me nowâ€™. Now, who would leave if such situation arises? He went on to praise my skills to the round2 interviewer and I then thought that I have cracked it. Also, the round 2 and 3 went super easy as there were no technical questions at all but just discussions about my projects and hackathons. After the rounds, I was being given the vibes that I was selected; one of the interviewers introduced me to some of his colleagues, we had random chit-chats etc. But, then theÂ result came and I was not selected. Of course, I did not feel good, not because I was rejected (already had some) but because I felt betrayed. If any recruiter is reading this, then please donâ€™t get the hopes ofÂ a candidate high only to crush it later. And if you are a candidate, then it sure will feel very bad but keep your cool; maybe the company does not deserve you. For me at least, it turned out like this: later that day, I got a far better offer which I accepted and thanked Oracle for rejecting me ðŸ˜‰
