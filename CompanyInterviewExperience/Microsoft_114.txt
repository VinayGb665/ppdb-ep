Round 1:
	We were given 3 coding questions.There were many different sets.Most questions were implementation based.Some of them were based on data structure like linklist and bst.
	They were:- Inorder successor of given node in bst,merge two sorted linklist in reverse order,longest increasing subsequence.Top 45 were selected after this round; from which top 5 were called directly for personal interview and rest went for group fly.Time 75 minutes.

Round 2(Group Fly):
	In this round all candidates were asked to write code on paper for given problem.The problem was:- Given an array,find the maximum average of elements in a window of size ‘K’.Time 25 minutes.Top 10 students were selected for personal interview.

Personal Interview 1:
	It was a technical round.I was asked to write code for two questions.First was to reverse a given string.In second question I was asked to print each character appearing in string with its frequency in lexicographical order.Then he asked difference between array,stack and heap.After that I was asked what should I test if I am tester of an application.At last he asked me to write an SQL query.Some of students were shortlisted for next interview.

Personal Interview 2:
	It was HR/Technical Round.He asked me to introduce myself and also asked about my hobbies.He gave me two coding questions.First was to longest palidromic substring in given string.Second was to traverse a matrix in spiral order.Then he asked me about my project.After that he asked a puzzle on how to divide a 10 m rope into 5 equal parts without using any measuring instruments.At last he asked me the difference between multi threading,multi tasking and multi programming.6 students were shortlisted for next interview.
Personal Interview 3:
	This was the last round.In this round interviewer asked me about uses of heap and hash.Then he asked me to explain 4 normal forms and the requirement for de-normalisation.At last he asked some questions on my project.All 6 students were selected for the internship.
