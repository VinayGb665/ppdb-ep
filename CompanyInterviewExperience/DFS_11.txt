Given an array A of N numbers where Ai represent the value of the (i+1)th node. Also given are M pair of edges where u and v represent the nodes that are connected by an edge. The task is to find the sum of the minimum element in all the connected components of the given undirected graph. If a node has no connectivity to any other node, count it as a component with one node. 
Examples:
Input: a[] = {1, 6, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9, 5, 10} m = 5
1 2
3 4
5 6
7 8
9 10 
Output: 15
Connected components are: 1–2, 3–4, 5–6, 7–8 and 9–10
Sum of Minimum of all them : 1 +  2  + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 
Input: a[] = {2, 5, 3, 4, 8} m = 2
1 4
4 5
Output: 10

Approach: Finding connected components for an undirected graph is an easier task. Doing either a BFS or DFS starting from every unvisited vertex will give us our connected components. Create a visited[] array which has initially all nodes marked as False. Iterate all the nodes, if the node is not visited, call DFS() function so that all the nodes connected directly or indirectly to the node are marked as visited. While visiting all the directly or indirectly connected nodes, store the minimum value of all nodes. Create a variable sum which stores the summation of the minimum of all these connected components. Once all the nodes are visited, sum will have the answer to the problem. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach:
