Given two unsorted arrays of distinct elements, the task is to find all pairs from both arrays whose sum is equal to x.

A Naive approach is to simply run two loops and pick elements from both arrays. One by one check that both elements sum is equal to given value x or not.

An Efficient solution of this problem is to hashing. Hash table is implemented using unordered_set in C++. We store all first array elements in hash table. For elements of second array, we  subtract every element from x and check the result in hash table. If result is present, we print the element and key in hash (which is an element of first array).
