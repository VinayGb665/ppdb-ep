Round 1 : (Online)
The first round was an online round.
It consisted of 45 questions and the time allotted was 60 minutes. The questions were not very tough but time was the major constraint here. You need to be 100 percent focused and refrain from making any calculation errors.
The test was MCQ type and questions were asked from Verbal Ability, Logical Reasoning, Data Sufficiency, Data Redundancy, Data Interpretation and Quantitative Aptitude. You should try to get through with the Verbal Ability and the Logical Reasoning sections as fast as possible, so that you can have sufficient time for the rest, since the questions were quite time consuming.
This round was the main eliminating round and around 30 out of around 400 students were called for round 2.
Round 2:(Interview)
In this round both HR as well as technical questions were asked. All you need to do is answer all their questions confidently and you should be through. There were 2 panelists and they were very friendly and they helped me out if I was unaware of anything they asked.
I can divide the questions asked to me into 3 broad categories.
This was all about the 2nd round. Around 15 people cleared this and were called for the 3rd round.
Round 3:(HR Interview)
Nothing technical was asked in this round.
This round was more of confirming if I was suitable for the job. They asked me if I was comfortable with traveling since the job demanded frequent traveling. Whether or not I was planning about further studies.
This was a short interview and in the end I had to fill up a form in which I had to state my preference of location as well as some other personal information.
 
This was about it. In about 2 hours the results were declared and 10 students were selected.
GeeksforGeeks has been really helpful to me and this was my attempt to give back a bit. Hope this helps. Cheers!
