Given a positive integer n. The problem is to find the sum of the given series 1 + (1+2) + (1+2+3) + (1+2+3+4) + …… + (1+2+3+4+…+n), where i-th term in the series is the sum of first i odd natural numbers.
Examples:

Naive Approach: Using two loops get the sum of each i-th term and then add those sum to the final sum.
