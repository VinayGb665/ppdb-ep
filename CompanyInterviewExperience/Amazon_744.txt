I’ve attended the Amazon interview in Hyderabad, This was kindle team, I got rejected but I’d like to share the experience, thought of giving back something to geeksforgeeks, which was a great reference for me.
Written test 
Very straight forward
1. Given a linked list, sort without extra space.
I wrote merge sort
2. Methods to serialize & deserialize a tree ,must complete the below 2 monthods. File serialize (node *root) & node * deserialize(File f)
Cleared the written test, I was told this after 1:30 Hrs.
First round
1. Find diameter of a tree, I’ve seen the question here, But i didn’t recollect.. So solved my self..in some primitive way which made me write code with difficulty.
2. Find a lowest common Ancestor, The variation was the tree was just a Binary Tree, Not BST, It was interesting to solve as i know only BST variation.
Second round
1. Given an array randomize it,
2. Write all possible permutations of a array of size z.
3. Given a 2-D array of 0s and 1s, find islands in it. An Island is 1s together. E.g (below there is U shaped island)
0100001
0100001
0100001
0100001
0111111
4. Write a method to check if a tree is BST or not. I wrote some stupid mistake in this code, probably that gave away my interview.
Third round
1. So many HR like questions. Why Amazon, Why u want to leave, Why u dont want to stay, what did you do to stay back, biggest challenge, worst mistake, etc etc.. blabbered something.
2. Write a method that will test a function which merges 2 sorted linked lists.
3. Design a system, which can convert books from one format to another
Fourth Round
Only one design question: Design a email client.
After 4 days and lot of anticipation, I got a mail saying I got rejected, Was wondering what they exactly look for.
