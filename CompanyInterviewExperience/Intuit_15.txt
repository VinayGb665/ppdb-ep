Written round:
1. Write a parser which takes java file as input and give count of uncommented lines as output. I wrote code with regular expressions, but I think he was expecting some state transition sort of approach.
2. Given a large file in which one no. occurs in strict majority(>50%). Find that no.
F2F:
1. Mostly discussed written round questions.
2. Secondary sort with map reduce.
