The recruiter approached me via linkedin and sent me an Hackerrank test. After clearing it, i was invited for f2f interviews at their Hyderabad office.
F2F-1 : With One lead developer
– A discussion on my current work and my role in it.
– I was given ‘Least Common Ancestor’ problem and was asked to write code on white board and trace the same for various test-cases.
– Array vs Linked-List for implementing stack and was asked to write code on board for both approches.
F2F-2: Two interviewers were present.
– Discussion about Classes Vs Interfaces and the differences in Practical Usage.
– Discussion on memory layout for ArrayList and Hashmap.
– Fibonacci-series with DP and then was asked to reduce the no of lines of code to minimum.
F2F-3: A senior guy, probably India Head.
– An overview of my current project and a few follow-up questions.
– Basic Questions on SQL.
– A discussion on their product and role being interviewed for.
After that, the HR business partner spoke to me for a few mins about the Salary expectations and stuff.
Overall, it was a pleasant experience. Some one who has a good knowledge of OOP and DS basics, should be easily able to get through.
