Given a string, check if all the characters of the string are same or not.
Examples:


Simple Way

To find whether string has all the same characters. Traverse the whole string from index 1 and check whether that character matches with first character of string or not. If yes, than match until string size. If no, than break the loop.

Quick Way (Not time complexity wise, but in terms of number of lines of code)

The idea is to use find_first_not_of() in C++ STL. 
find_first_not_of() finds and returns position of first character that does not match a specified character (or any of the specified characters in case of a string).
