C++ map stores keys in ordered form (Note that it internally use a self balancing binary search tree).  Ordering is internally done using operator ” < "   So if we use our own data type as key, we must overload this operator for our data type.
Let us consider a map having key data type as a structure and mapped value as integer.

We can also make < operator a member of structure/class.

What happens if we do not overload < operator?
We get compiler error if we try to insert anything into the map.
