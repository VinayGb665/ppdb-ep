Sierpinski triangle is a fractal and attractive fixed set with the overall shape of an equilateral triangle. It subdivides recursively into smaller triangles.

Examples : 

Approach : 
Sierpinski Triangle will be constructed from an equilateral triangle by repeated removal of triangular subsets.
Steps for Construction :
1 . Take any equilateral triangle .
2 . Divide it into 4 smaller congruent triangle and remove the central triangle .
3 . Repeat step 2 for each of the remaining smaller triangles forever.
