A typical Priority Queue requires following operations to be efficient. 
A Binary Heap supports above operations with following time complexities:

A Self Balancing Binary Search Tree like AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc can also support above operations with same time complexities.
So why is Binary Heap Preferred for Priority Queue?
Is Binary Heap always better?
Although Binary Heap is for Priority Queue, BSTs have their own advantages and the list of advantages is in-fact bigger compared to binary heap.
