The unordered_multiset::equal_range() is a built-in function in C++ STL which returns the range in which all the elements are equal to a given value. It returns a pair of iterators where the first is an iterator pointing to the lower bound of the range and second is an iterator pointing to the upper bound of the range. If there is no element equal to a given value in the container, then it returns a pair where both lower and upper bound points to the position after the end of the container.

Parameters:  The function accepts an element val whose range is to be returned.
