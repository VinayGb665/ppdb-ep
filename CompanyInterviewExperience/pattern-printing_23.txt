Given a number N, print a hollow square of side with N asterisks(‘*’), and inside it print a hollow square of side N-4 asterisks(‘*’).
Examples :

The idea is to run two nested loops from 1 to n for rows and columns and now to check for conditions when to print an asterisk(‘*’) and when to print space(‘ ‘). The condition for printing asterisks will be:
All of the indexes which do not satisfy the above condition will contain space.
Below is the implementation of above idea:
