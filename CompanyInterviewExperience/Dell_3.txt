Dell had come on campus for 2 profiles-Software Developer and Business Analyst.
Round 1 (Software Developer):
Online Technical assessment containing 3 sections.
In C++, contained output questions of mutual recursion, inheritance, virtual functions,etc. 
Round 1 (Business Analyst):
Shortlisting based on Resumes.
Round 2 (Business Analyst):
Written MCQ test of data interpretation. Contained 20-25 questions based on graphs, paragraphs, logical reasoning, maths, etc.
I had got shortlisted for both the profiles.
Technical Interview Round -1:
After that I asked if I’ll be working at a project that spans a long period or different projects at different times.
Then I also asked if it’s possible to switch in between the projects in case we find we can fit better into another one.
 
Business Analyst Interview Round 1: (Panel interview on Skype)
Based upon above 2 rounds , I was straight called for the Managerial Round.
Managerial Round:
A different table for salary as salaries could be different for each month.


She said I had missed out the group by clause. Then she said you need to improve upon it and told we are done. On this I requested her to test me on logic. She agreed and gave me a puzzle.
HR ROUND:
I was offered the Software developer profile (my first preference out of the 2 roles).
