The selection procedure consisted of an online round followed by two Personal Interviews.
Online Round:
The first round had 20 MCQs and two coding questions. The MCQs were based on the concepts from OS, DSA, compilers, architecture etc.
The coding questions were:
1. Given an array of positive and negative numbers, arrange them in an alternate fashion such that every positive number is followed by negative and vice-versa maintaining the order of appearance.
2. Given a n x m matrix, print the elements diagonal wise from top to bottom.
First round of PI :
1. Given a number n find the number of balanced parentheses expressions of that length.
Input: 2
Output: 1 which is (),
Input: 4
Output: 2 which are (()) and ()().
I gave a complex solution involving segment tree in which he pointed out the mistakes and then asked to write a code to check if a given expression is balanced or not.
2. Tell something about LRU. What DS will you use for it? Write pseudo code for it.
(Hint : Quite simple..Use doubly LL)
Second round of PI: 
The interviewer introduced himself first and then asked me about myself.
We had a discussion on my projects.
1. Given two binary trees, write pseudo code to determine if one is a subtree of the other. I answered it and then he modified the question to check if the other tree elements are the subset of the elements of the first tree. (Hint: Inorder traversal)
2. Given a sorted circular linked list which is rotated at some point, write pseudo code to insert a new node. Ex: 8 1 2 5 7 and insert 6.
