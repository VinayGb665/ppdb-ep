2. Find a sub-array in an array of 0 and 1 such that flipping bits maximizes no. of 1s.

Round 2: Telephonic Interview 1
1. Mirror Image of binary tree (Recursive Solution Required)
2. Mirror image of binary tree (Iterative Solution Required)
3. Mirror of n-ary tree.
4. Generate all k length combination from n length string, characters can appear multiple times, print unique combinations only.

Round 3: Telephonic Interview 2
1. Sqrt of an integer till given decimal places. (Expected complexity – logn and only a single function can be made which has to deal with all the cases)
2. Merge two balanced binary search tree.

Round 4: F2F
1. Isomorphic binary tree check.
2. Count all possible decodings of a string of digit.
3. Given log files consisting of product bought and customer id, print top k purchased items at any time. If billions of items are there and it is not possible for a single machine to handle them then how will you handle this condition. Discussed several approaches.

Round 5: F2F
1. Top view of binary tree.
2. Given an expression number of different ways to evaluate the expression.
    Exp. 1+2*3, can be evaluated as (1+2)*3 or 1+(2*3)
    Later he asked me to find out all the possible answers as well.

Round 6: F2F (Technical + hr)
Discussion about project I completed during internship.
Technical Questions asked were –
1. K-th largest element in bst.
2. Array vs Linked list.
Several behavioral questions.

Round 7: F2F 
1. Hotel booking problem.
2. Next greater number with same set of digits. O(n) solution was required.
3. Discussion on TRIE.
I would like to thank GeeksForGeeks for providing a variety of questions of all topics.
