I applied through campus/college. The company visited our college. There was an online test in the college followed by the interview process at their Noida center.
Round 1: Online coding test + Psychometric test.
The online coding test was of 110 marks.There were 5 questions each having different marks (5+10+20+30+45=110). Questions’ level was from very easy to moderate. Total time allotted to solve these 5 questions was 2 hours.

After that, There was one psychometric test also.This test was of 1 hr. Try to attempt all the questions in this.
Some 14-15 students appeared for the first round and only 5 were through to the next round.
Round 2:After clearing the first round we were called to their Noida center for  the interviews.
This was a technical one.The interviewer asked me about my areas of interest, I said Java and DBMS, so he asked me questions based on Java(mostly on OOPs) and SQL queries . There were a few simple DS questions also like insertion/deletion in LLs etc.The interview went for around 1 hr.                                                                                            There could be questions from your resume and specially projects anytime so be prepared for it.
After this round only 2 students were selected for the next round.
Note:This is the main round and if you crack this, you’ve a very good chance of getting selected.
Round 3: Technical + HR.
Technical: The interviewer was some senior level manager.He asked me some questions based on database design, programming languages(like diff b/w for() and while() ) and one program. The interview lasted for around 20-30 mins. My interview didn’t go well.
