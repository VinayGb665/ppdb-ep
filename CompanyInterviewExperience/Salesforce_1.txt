Salesforce visited our campus in August 2018 to recruit students for Associate Member of Technical Staff. The eligibility criteria was quite strict. Only CSE students with a CGPA above 7.5 and with no backlogs ever in college were eligible. The process consisted of 4 rounds, 1 Online test and 3 rounds of F2F interviews.
3 out of 4 people made it to the 3rd round. Unfortunately I wasnâ€™t one of them and finally 2 were offered full time employment.
