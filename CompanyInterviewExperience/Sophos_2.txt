Round 2: Technical Interview
Second round was Technical Interview. Out of 135 candidates 21 candidates were shortlisted for this round. There were 2 interviewers interviewing each candidate at the same time. In this round they mainly focus on your technical way of thinking and your knowledge in the technical domain. Please do not get panic that they ask on networking and all, there is no such thing. They asked questions regarding my CV, and I was having a research paper mentioned in my CV so they asked me on that also. After that as my seminar was on Malware itself, being a security company they drilled me in Malware, its types and all that basic stuff. Also they asked my about Interrupts, its types and who is having higher priority (Hardware or Software). If you are a technical person this round won’t be an issue for you.
Round 3: HR Interview
Third (Final) round was HR round. Out of 21 candidates only 5 of us made it to the HR round. You can expect same HR questions that are asked on a regular basis. About your background and all. Make sure you present yourself very well in this round.
