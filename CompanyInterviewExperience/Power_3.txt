Power2SME visited our campus for full-time role as well as 6-month intern role for master student.
The 1st online round was hosted on mettl platform, consisting of 70 MCQs (Aptitude, reasoning, technical and English) and 1 code.
It had 2 coding questions and 20 MCQs.
Q1. Given an unsorted array A, find the maximum possible summation for the visit either from A[i] to A[0] or from A[i] to A[n-1] but the condition is that you have to add equal amount from each elements over the range.
There were 3 technical  and 1 HR round and Every interview round started with the cliche “tell me about yourself” and ended with “do you have any questions”.
In technical rounds basically they start with your interest and then ask their questions. Mine was DS and Algorithm so some of questions are as:
1) Check whether a linked list is palindrome or not. Try to explain each and every possible way and explain time and complexity of each step.
2) Check whether two binary tree are mirror image of each other or not.
3) Reverse a given Stack, again with each and every approach but they were interested in O(1) space complexity.
4) Construct BST with the help of pre order and post order. Discussed many corner cases.
5) Swap two numbers with different approaches and finally we ended up to the solution in 1 line.
6) Given a n*n matrix having all elements as 0 or 1 and all rows are sorted. You have to find the row with maximum 1 and also that number of 1s.
7) Design power() function in O(logn).
8) Subset sum problem
And they asked a lot of question on my project and many basic HR questions.
I suggest you to be confident and have deep knowledge in your area of interest. My recommendation is geksforgeeks and you can use stackoverflow for different aspects of any problem.
Thanks geeksforgeeks for such a huge platform for us.
