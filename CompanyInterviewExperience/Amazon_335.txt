Given an unsorted array, find the minimum difference between any pair in given array.
Examples :
Method 1 (Simple: O(n2)
A simple solution is to use two loops.

Method 2 (Efficient: O(n Log n)
The idea is to use sorting. Below are steps.
1) Sort array in ascending order.  This step takes  O(n Log n) time.
2) Initialize difference as infinite.   This step takes  O(1) time.
3) Compare all adjacent pairs in sorted array and keep track of minimum difference. This step takes  O(n) time.
Below is implementation of above idea.
