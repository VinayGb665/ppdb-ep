A STL based simple implementation of BFS using queue and vector in STL. The adjacency list is represented using vectors of vector. 
Below is an example BFS starting from source vertex 1. Note that there can be multple BFSs possible for a graph (even from a particular vertex).

For more details of BFS, refer  this post . 
The code here is simplified such that it could be used in competitive coding.
