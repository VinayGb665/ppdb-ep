Buyhatke visited our campus to offer 6 months internship for the role of Software Developer. There were a total of 3 rounds. CSE, IT, ECE and EEE branches with a GPA above 7.00 were eligible. There was an initial resume based shortlisting done by the company. There were a total of 3 rounds.
Unfortunately neither of the 2 shortlists were offered internships.
