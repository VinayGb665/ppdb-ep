Online Coding Round:
Telephonic Interview 1:
Telephonic Interview 2:
Face to Face:
Note: Time and space complexity were discussed in each of the following questions. And for each question I was asked to optimize the algorithm and later write the working code for it.Also in each round the current project was discussed.
Round 1:
Round 2 (Manager’s Round):
A thorough discussion on an issue: If I am an owner of company which is selling some product. So, how shall I store my data in Database such that when any analyst comes and asks for any information then I could provide him most precise values. It mainly consisted which data should be stored and how it should be stored.
Round 3:
Round 4:
NOTE: I didn’t face any HR round, all though in each rounds I was asked about the reason for the change.
In all it was a great experience, and interviewers were really cool and gave a plenty of time to think and code, sometimes suggested/hinted if I got stuck.
GeeksforGeeks has been extremely helpful for me in preparing.
