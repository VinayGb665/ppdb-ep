In combinatorics, the Eulerian Number A(n, m), is the number of permutations of the numbers 1 to n in which exactly m elements are greater than previous element.
For example, there are 4 permutations of the number 1 to 3 in which exactly 1 element is greater than the previous elements.

Examples :

 Eulerian Numbers are the coefficients of the Eulerian polynomials described below.

The Eulerian polynomials are defined by the exponential generating function

The Eulerian polynomials can be computed by the recurrence


An explicit formula for A(n, m) is

We can calculate A(n, m) by recurrence relation:

Example:
Suppose, n = 3 and m = 1.
Therefore,
A(3, 1)
= (3 – 1) * A(2, 0) + (1 + 1) * A(2, 1)
        = 2 * A(2, 0) + 2 * A(2, 1)
        = 2 * 1 + 2 * ( (2 – 1) * A(1, 0) + (1 + 1) * A(1, 1))
        = 2 + 2 * (1 * 1 + 2 * ((1 – 1) * A(0, 0) + (1 + 1) * A(0, 1))
        = 2 + 2 * (1 + 2 * (0 * 1 + 2 * 0)
        = 2 + 2 * (1 + 2 * 0)
        = 2 + 2 * 1
        = 2 + 2
        = 4
We can verify this with example shown above.
