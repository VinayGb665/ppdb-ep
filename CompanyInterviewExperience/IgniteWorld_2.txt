I was interviewed for windows developer.  
Round 1 – telephonic  
Round 2 – f2f DS  
Round 3 – simulation round 
Building an app in 3 hours using Flickr api where the user can search for a tag and it returns photos with that tag. The feed needed to have infinite scrolling where more photos are loaded on reaching the end of the current set of photos.  
Things that mattered- 
Round 4 – f2f with Director of Engineering(DOE)
I was just asked a single question here, a puzzle, asked in form of a programming problem. I was asked to suggest solutions considering both, DS and the logical solution of the puzzle. 
There’s a circular hotel lobby with doors that leads to different rooms. There light inside the room can be on/off. You need to check and turn off light in every room. Number of rooms is not known, you can travel in both directions. 
Identifying the starting point holds the crux here as the lobby is circular and number of rooms is not known. 
Round 5 – HR  
I would like to thanks geeksforgeeks that helped me immensely in my preparations for this interview.
