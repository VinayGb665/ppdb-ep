First of all a big thanx to you guys, you are really awesome, without any mean you are supporting each and every person , thank you alot 🙂 I recently got placed at HSBC , i would like to share my interview experience
HSBC recently visited our campus for hiring software developers (Full Time). Depending on your performance in all the process they classified two types of sub profiles: “Acer” and “Strikers”, Acer was their top profile for that hiring.
1st Round-(Aptitude + Programming Fundamentals)
2nd Round- (Coding round)
Time duration for this round was 30 minutes, it comprised of 2 basic coding questions.
3rd Round – (Technical Round)
I was called amongst the first 8 students to be interviewed. It started with the mostly frequently asked question “Tell me about yourself” I answered about that (be honest here, and be prepared for this question in almost all interviews). Then she started asking from my resume, she asked me about the research paper I have written, and then she started asking about my projects. I had around 30-40s of video for the demonstration of each and every project, (Picture says 100 words, but a videos says 1000 !!) and she was very much impressed by my projects and the way I presented them to her. Most of the time she was discussing my projects and kept asking me about the technologies I have used and a short description on the same.
I was then shortlisted for the next round after waiting for 1-2 hours.
