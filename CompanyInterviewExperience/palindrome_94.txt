Given a range of numbers, print all palindromes in the given range. For example if the given range is {10, 115}, then output should be {11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 101, 111}
We can run a loop from min to max and check every number for palindrome. If number is palindrome, we can simply print it.
