compare() is a public member function of string class. It compares the value of the string object (or a substring) to the sequence of characters specified by its arguments.
The compare() can process more than one argument for each string so that one can specify a substring by its index and by its length.
Return type : compare() returns an integer value rather than a Boolean value.
