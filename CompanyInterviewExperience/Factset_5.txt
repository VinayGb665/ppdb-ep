Given a matrix, the task is to construct a linked list matrix in which each node is connected to its right and down node.
Example:
A recursive solution for this problem has been already discussed in this post. Below is an iterative approach for the problem:

Below is the implementation of the above approach: 
Run on IDE
Time complexity:  O(M * N)
