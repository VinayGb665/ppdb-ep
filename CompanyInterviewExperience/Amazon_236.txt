Round 1- 90-100 min
In 2 min They told me that i was cleared for 2 round.
Round 2
I went for 2 round without wasting time as Spot On offers were to be given. Interviewer was slightly weired and he straight on went for the ques.
 There is data available for different vehicles and all vehicles have n parameters which distinguish it with other vehicle so given huge data you need to separate them in different
lists based on some parameters matching. How will you proceed->Then he said 3 parameters are there and if all 3 parameters match then they belong to same list.
I told him lets sort the data according to first parameter then for then sort acc to 2 para and so on..(something like Radix sort).
He told me to use Hash-Map and model the whole ideaâ€¦.building the structure for each vehicle and  then use key to do hash-mapping.
I implemented it but due to too much overwriting, He was  not looking impressed but he told its correct.
DO u have any questions.
After this Round I was rejected.
