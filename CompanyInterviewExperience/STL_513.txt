The C++ function std::algorithm::is_permutation() tests whether a sequence is permutation of other or not. It uses operator == for comparison. This function was defined in C++11.
Syntax:
The function considers as many elements of this sequence as those in the range [first1, last1]. If this sequence is shorter, it causes undefined behaviour.
