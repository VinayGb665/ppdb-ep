Goldman Sachs conducted a Code Sprint where 6 challenges were given. I solved 4 of them and was ranked below 1600 out of 10120 candidates. After this I got a call from the HR to appear for the next rounds.
 
1st Round: HackerRank Test (1 hr 30 min)
1. Given n and an array of strings, print the string that contains the digits (1, 2, 3), if there are multiple strings that satisfies the conditions, print them in ascending order.
2. Given a sequence of M and N with M representing increasing and N representing decreasing, output the smallest number that follows this pattern.
You need to solve atleast one question in order to progress to further round.
 
2nd Round: CoderPad Interview (1 hr)
This is a screen sharing round where the interviewer will be on call with you.
The interviewer asked about my experience, I answered 1 year. Probably the problem difficulty is based on the candidate’s experience.
1. Given a string, the task is to find maximum consecutive repeating character in string

2. Given a string, print the reverse order of the string.

You need to solve atleast one question in order to progress to further round.
 
3rd Round : Face to Face Technical Interview (45 min)
This was a 2 on 1 face to face technical round in Goldman Sachs office campus.
1. Write a query to get the below output.
2. Given an array of numbers where each number is in continuous series and would not be repeated once the series is over, print the count of each number.
3. Write a program to count frequency of each number in an array of elements without using a hash table.
I gave O(n) complexity solution, but the interviewer was not satisfied with it and asked me to implement a balanced binary search tree which I couldn’t.
