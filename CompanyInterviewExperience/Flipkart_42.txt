Given an array of n integers where each value represents number of chocolates in a packet. Each packet can have variable number of chocolates. There are m students, the task is to distribute chocolate packets such that:

A simple solution is to generate all subsets of size m of arr[0..n-1].  For every subset, find the difference between maximum and minimum elements in it. Finally return minimum difference.
An efficient solution is based on the observation that, to minimize difference, we must choose consecutive elements from a sorted packets. We first sort the array arr[0..n-1], then find the subarray of size m with minimum difference between last and first elements.

Time Complexity : O(n Log n) as we apply sorting before subarray search.
