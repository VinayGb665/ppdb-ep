Interviewers of Directi are completely different from other companies. He asked me relax first and started talking in hindi about the college and stuff(completely irrelevant) and then he gave me a question(that too in hindi only) .
2 round
Another cool person but a little tough ques.
HR+ Technical round
This was the worst round because it was the skype round and there was communication problem. The interview started with summer intern project discussion and I required to draw some diagrams to explain him and it was really difficult to explain him through the poor communication but he somehow got the idea of project.
