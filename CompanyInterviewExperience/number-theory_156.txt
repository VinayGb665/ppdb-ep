Output:
A Goldbach number is a positive integer that can be expressed as the sum of two odd primes. Since four is the only even number greater than two that requires the even prime 2 in order to be written as the sum of two primes, another form of the statement of Goldbach’s conjecture is that all even integers greater than 4 are Goldbach numbers.
