Given an positive integer n. Count total number of ways to express ‘n’ as sum of odd positive integers.
Simple approach is to find recursive nature of problem. The number ‘n’ can be written as sum of odd integers from either (n-1)th number or (n-2)th number. Let the total number of ways to write ‘n’ be ways(n). The value of ‘ways(n)’ can be written by recursive formula as follows:
The above expression is actually the expression for Fibonacci numbers. Therefore problem is reduced to find the nth fibonnaci number.

Output:
Note: The time complexity of the above implementation is O(n). It can be further optimized up-to O(Logn) time using Fibonacci function optimization by Matrix Exponential.
