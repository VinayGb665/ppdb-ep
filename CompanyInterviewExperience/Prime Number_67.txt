Given two four digit prime numbers, suppose 1033 and 8179, we need to find the shortest path from 1033 to 8179 by altering only single digit at a time such that every number that we get after changing a digit is prime. For example a solution is    1033, 1733, 3733, 3739,    3779,    8779,    8179    
Examples:
The question can be solved by BFS and it is a pretty interesting to solve as a starting problem for beginners. We first find out all 4 digit prime numbers till 9999 using technique of Sieve of Eratosthenes. And then using those numbers formed the graph using adjacency list. After forming the adjacency list, we used simple BFS  to solve the problem.
