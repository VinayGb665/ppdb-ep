Off late, Amazon had an On-campus recruitment. Here is the interview process.
1)     Written Round
2)     Interview Round 1
 
3)     Interview Round 2
 
4)     Interview Round 3
 
5)     Interview Round 4
(This I believe, was probably a stress interview a.k.a Bar Raiser Round. The motive was to shift your attention from one topic to another rapidly and see if you can handle the questions that follow.)
