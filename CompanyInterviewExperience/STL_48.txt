The exp2() is a builtin function in C++ STL that computes the base-2 exponential function of a given number. It can also be written as 2num.
Syntax:
Parameter:The function accepts a single mandatory parameter num which specifies the value of the exponent. It can be positive, negative or 0. The parameter can be of type double, float or long double.
Return Value: It returns either a double, float or long double value which is equivalent to 2num.

Errors and Execptions: If the magnitude of the result is too large to be represented by a value of the return type, the function returns HUGE_VAL (or HUGE_VALF or HUGE_VALL) with the proper sign, and an overflow range error occurs.
