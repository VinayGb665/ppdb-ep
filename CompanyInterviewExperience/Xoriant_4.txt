ROUND 1 (30 min):
It was technical aptitude and general aptitude with some 2-3 codes. Technical aptitude composed of questions on basic computer science and engineering subjects. General aptitude composed of simple questions based on routine topics like speed, time & distance, clocks, calendar, etc. Problem statements were of simple to moderate level. As far as I remember, I coded in C and C++.
ROUND 2 (6-7 min):
Almost 35-40 candidates were shortlisted for this round out of around 150-170. Groups were made as 6-7 candidate in each group. The topics given for discussion were general and based on current affairs. Time slot of 6-7 minutes were given to each group. Again 20-25 candidates were shortlisted for the next round.
ROUND 3 (45 min):
In Technical interview following questions were asked:
â€¢ Introduce yourself.
â€¢ Favorite subject.
â€¢ Then the interviewer switched to my project and discussion on it lasted for very long ; almost till the end of interview. (from where did you get this idea ? how did you implemented it ? How this project could be scaled up ? use-case for the project ? ).
ROUND 4 (20-25 min):
This interview could also be called as Technical Interview II since no non-technical questions were there, it was wholly technical interview only.
Here I was asked about:
â€¢ Types of Joins in DBE.
â€¢ Difference between statefull and stateless protocols.

â€¢ Some simple question from DS, unable to recall exactly, it was based on linear DS.
â€¢ He asked me something about cache and session in Web, since I had almost no knowledge of the domain, I said I am sorry I wonâ€™t be able to answer question in this domain. Luckily I had answered almost all previous questions with good real time examples.
ROUND 5 (45 min):
