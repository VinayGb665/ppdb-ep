Given a string of length N, find the length of the smallest sub-string consisting of maximum distinct characters. Note : Our output can have same character.

Examples:

Method 1 (Brute Force)
We can consider all sub-strings one by one and check for each sub-string both conditions together
1. sub-string’s distinct characters is equal to maximum distinct characters
2. sub-sting’s length should be minimum .
Time Complexity : O(n^3)
Run on IDE
Output:
Method 2 (Efficient)
Please refer Smallest window that contains all characters of string itself for implementation and more details.
