For calculating the smallest of all the elements in a given list, we have std::min, but what if we want to find the smallest not in the whole list, but in a sub-section of the list. To serve this purpose, we have std::min_element in C++.
std::min_element is defined inside the header file <algorithm>  and it returns an iterator pointing to the element with the smallest value in the range [first, last).
Unlike std::min, which can be used in three ways, std::min_element can be used in two ways. The comparisons can be performed using either operator < (first version), or using a pre-defined function (second version). If more than one element satisfies the condition of being the smallest, the iterator returned points to the first of such elements.
The two versions are defined as given below:
