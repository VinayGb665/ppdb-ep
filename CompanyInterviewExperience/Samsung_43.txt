A string contains patterns of the form 1(0+)1 where (0+) represents any non-empty consecutive sequence of 0’s. Count all such patterns. The patterns are allowed to overlap.
Note : It contains digits and lowercase characters only. The string is not necessarily a binary. 100201 is not a valid pattern.
One approach to solve the problem is discussed here, other using Regular expressions is given in Set 2
Examples:

Let size of input string be n.
1. Iterate through index ‘0’ to ‘n-1’.
2. If we encounter a ‘1’, we iterate till the elements are ‘0’.
3. After the stream of zeros ends, we check whether we encounter a ‘1’ or not.
4. Keep on doing this till we reach the end of string.
Below is the implementation of the above method.
