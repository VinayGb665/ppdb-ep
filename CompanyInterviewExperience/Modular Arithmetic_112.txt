Write a program to reverse digits of an integer.

Examples :
ITERATIVE WAY
Algorithm:
Example:
  num  = 4562
  rev_num = 0
  rev_num = rev_num *10 + num%10  =  2
  num = num/10 = 456
  rev_num = rev_num *10 + num%10  =  20 + 6 = 26
  num = num/10 = 45
  rev_num = rev_num *10 + num%10  =  260 + 5 = 265
  num = num/10 = 4
  rev_num = rev_num *10 + num%10  =  265 + 4 = 2654
  num = num/10 = 0

Reverse digits of an integer with overflow handled
Note that above above program doesnâ€™t consider leading zeroes.  For example, for 100 program will print 1.  If you want to print 001 then see this comment from Maheshwar.
Try extensions of above functions that should also work for floating point numbers.
