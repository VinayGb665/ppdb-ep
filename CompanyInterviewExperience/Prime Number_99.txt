Given a number, determine whether it is a valid Hyperperfect Number.
A number n is called k-hyperperfect if: n = 1 + k ∑idi where all di are the proper divisors of n.
Taking k = 1 will give us perfect numbers. 
The first few k-hyperperfect numbers are 6, 21, 28, 301, 325, 496, 697, … with the corresponding values of k being 1, 2, 1, 6, 3, 1, 12, …

Given k, we can perform a few checks in special cases to determine whether the number is hyperperfect:
