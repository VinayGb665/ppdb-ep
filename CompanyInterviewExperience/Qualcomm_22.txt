The questions had a negative marking of 0.25.
9 students were shortlisted out of 200 for the next round.

Round 2: Technical Interview
Interviewer began by asking me ‘What do you know about Qualcomm’ and then moved to on some general questions like:
– Difference between CDMA and GSM technologies
– Why CDMA was phased out
– What is 3G LTE
– How IoT can impact the communications industry.
(They expect you to know about their company thoroughly.)
This was followed by a thorough scan of my resume. Each and every project and internship was discussed in detail. For my project concerning Machine Learning, I was asked how about partitioning of dataset, choice of performance metric, RandomisedSearch versus GridSearch. 
Even the accomplishments on my resume were scrutinised. How I approached bug finding on site, difference between self XSS and reflected XSS, how do you suspect HPP.
So, basically if there is something on your resume, you should be aware of it in and out.
After this, he came on to coding problems.
Flatten a tree into a linked list
Some conceptual questions on pointers such as differences between int const *ptr and int * const ptr 
The interview concluded with which team would you like to join at Qualcomm.
Overall, it was a nice and friendly experience.
