In mathematics, Rosser’s Theorem states that the nth prime number is greater than the product of n and natural logarithm of n for all n greater than 1.
Mathematically, 
For n >= 1, if pn is the nth prime number, then
      pn > n * (ln n)
Approach for code:
Efficient generation of prime numbers using prime sieve and checking the condition of Rosser’s Theorem for each prime number individually.
