Online Written Test:
Multiple choice questions on aptitude and programming 2 coding questions.
F2F R1
1) Given a string of any length. print all possible combinations of string length k
Hint use recursion
2) Given a matrix, print in spiral order.
3) Verify whether given tree is BST or not.
Had solved as per the method 3 https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-program-to-check-if-a-binary-tree-is-bst-or-not/
Then he himself orally briefed about method 1 from the same link and asked me to write code for the same and figure out what’s wrong with the approach.  
F2F R2
1) Given a Node such that 
had to print all the paths from root to the file. if there is no file don’t print anything.
Note: This is not tree or graph.
The structure is like windows file system and hierarchy can be any long. So recursion will cause stack overflow. Solve it without recursion
2) Given a sorted array with one number having any number of duplicates
For eg [1,2,3,4,4,4,5,6]
Find the index of the first occur of duplicating element.
So for above example your function should return 3.
Hint: Use Binary search
3) Minimum number of jumps to reach end
Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element.
Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element).
If an element is 0, then cannot move through that element.
Example:
Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}
Output: 3 (1-> 3 -> 8 ->9)
F2F R3
Discussed about resume and projects worked upon.
1) Given a binary stream, state if the number is divisible by 3 at any point of time
Discussed 2-3 approaches.
2) Discussed various approached to implement dictionary.
3) Given a set print all possible subsets.
F2F R4 (directorial round, last one)
Discussed about my work projects and college projects as well.
Discussed various approaches and complexities for array rotation problem.
