I am sharing my off campus SDE interview experience with Amazon.
Online round: (1hr)
After two days I got the call to come Amazon office for F2F interviews:
1st Round:
2nd Round:
3rd Round:
After one week I got the call from HR for my BR round.
4th Round (BR Round):
In all the rounds, the most optimal production quality working code was required and if you get stuck, then they will give you HINTS but donâ€™t consider this in your favor!
