Given a number N, the task is to check whether it is fascinating or not.
Fascinating Number: When a number( 3 digits or more ) is multiplied by 2 and 3, and when both these products are concatenated with the original number, then it results in all digits from 1 to 9 present exactly once. There could be any number of zeros and are ignored.

Examples:

Input: 192
Output: Yes
After multiplication with 2 and 3, and concatenating with original number, resultant number is 192384576 which contains all digits from 1 to 9.
Input: 853
Output: No
After multiplication with 2 and 3, and concatenating with original number, the resultant number is 85317062559. In this, number 4 is missing and the number 5 has appeared multiple times.

Approach: 
Below is the implementation of above approach:

 0)
			return false;
		else
			$freq[$digit]++;
	}
	// Traversing through freq array to
	// check if any digit was missing
	for ($i = 1; $i < 10; $i++) 
	{
		if ($freq[$i] == 0)
			return false;
	}
	return true;
}

// Driver code

// Input number
$num = 192;

// Not a valid number
if ($num < 100)
	echo "No" ;

else
{
    // Calling the function to 
    // check if input number 
    // is fascinating or not
    $ans = isFascinating($num);
    if ($ans)
    	echo "Yes";
    else
    	echo "No";
}
