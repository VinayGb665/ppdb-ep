First Round consisted of 3 easy coding problems to be solved on an online platform (CoCubes) . The problems were fairly easy and didn’t require much thought . Extra marks were given for optimized solutions requiring less memory and time . Problems were as follows –
From those who qualified the online coding round – 14 people were selected for direct interview and 10 people were selected for an additional fly round . From those 10 , around 3-4 were selected for interviews.
First Interview: The interviewer asked me to give a short introduction about myself and then based on my disciplinary electives , he asked me to design a simple Information Retrieval system. Given a file containing various phrases , he asked me to provide an outline for building a query system such that it autocompletes the query the user is typing . He didn’t ask for any code , just for a basic outline of the functions that would be used and the data structures I thought would be implemented while building such a system.
Second Interview:Interviewer asked me two questions Algorithms – one was based on trees and DP and the other was a question on Depth First Search.
Third Interview:Interviewer asked a simple problem (Print all nodes at distance k from a given node). Solution is available on GeeksforGeeks.
