Given a square matrix the task is that we turn it by 180 degrees in anti-clockwise direction without using any extra space.
Examples :
Method : 1 (Only prints rotated matrix)
The solution of this problem is that to rotate a matrix by 180 degree we can easily follow that step 
From the above illustration we get that simply to rotate the matrix by 180 degree then we will have to print given matrix in reverse manner .
