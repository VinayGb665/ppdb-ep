RecyclerView is a ViewGroup added to the android studio as a successor of the GridView and ListView. It is an improvement on both of them and can be found in the latest v-7 support packages. It has been created to make possible construction of any lists with XML layouts as an item which can be customized vastly while improving on the efficiency of ListViews and GridViews. This improvement is achieved by recycling the views which are out of the visibility of the user. For example, if a user scrolled down to a position where the items 4 and 5 are visible; items 1, 2 and 3 would be cleared from the memory to reduce memory consumption. 
Implementation: To implement a basic RecyclerView three sub-parts are needed to be constructed which offer the users the degree of control they require in making varying designs of their choice.
