Given a number n, the task is to find the sum of all the divisors.
Examples :

A simple solution is to traverse through all divisors and add them.

Output :
An efficient solution is to use below formula.
Let p1, p2, … pk be prime factors of n.  Let a1, a2, .. ak be highest powers of p1, p2, .. pk respectively that divide n, i.e., we can write n as n = (p1a1)*(p2a2)* … (pkak).
How does above formula work?
So the task reduces to finding all prime factors and their powers.

Further Optimization. 
If there are multiple queries, we can use Sieve to find prime factors and their powers.
