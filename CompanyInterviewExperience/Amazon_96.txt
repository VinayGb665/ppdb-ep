The Selection process started with an Online Coding round.
20 MCQ and 2 Coding Questions:
MCQs were from OOPs, OS, DBMS, Networking etc.
Coding Questions:
Q – Rotate the given Matrix by a factor k. Input is given as two integers n,m (row and column of the matrix). Followed by n lines with m space separated integers as all the elements of the matrix. Last line has an integer k.
Input:
3 3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9
2
Output:
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3
Q – Given a string. Find all the palindromic partitions of the string. (Number of way the string can be partitioned so that all the partitions are palindrome)
Input:
NITIN
OUTPUT:
3
N I T I N
N ITI N
NITIN
Face2Face (Interview)
Round 1:
He asked coding questions straight away – 
Q- Add two numbers without using +,- operator, recursion or loop.
  Try to think in terms of half adder.
Q- Postfix to prefix without using recursion.
Q- Given an array of numbers. What is the largest no possible by concatenating all the numbers together.
Input:
5
21 30 1 9 98
Output:
99830211
Q – Write the heapify code.
Round 2:
Q – Level order traversal of a tree. Further he asked to optimise the code.
Q – Given a matrix. ‘0’ means empty room, ‘1’ means door, ‘-1’ means a wall. For every cell as an empty room find the distance to the nearest door (One cannot go through a wall).
Input:
5 5
0  0  1 -1  1
0 -1  0  0 -1
0  0 -1  0 -1
1 -1  1  0  0
0  0  0  0  0
Output:
2  1  0 -1  0
2 -1  1  2 -1
1  2 -1  2 -1
0 -1  0  1  2
1  2  1  2  3
** The door would be replaced with 0 as the distance to the nearest door would be 0.
I started by a backtracking solution. But the guy didn’t know what it was. I gave many more solutions and concluded with an O(N) bfs solution. 
Guys answer straight. Do not answer very complex algorithms, even though they are correct. Try to provide as brute-force solution as possible.
