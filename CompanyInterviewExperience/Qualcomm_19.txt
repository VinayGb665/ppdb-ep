It was a very good experience to face interview at Qualcomm (Hyderabad-2016)
I have attended the interview for a position of Software Engineer and My experience and Questions are mentioned below.
Round-1 Telephonic around (40min to 1hr) Medium level.
Note: All round questions were asked deeply and need to tell him until he convinced with the answers. After 7 days I got a call to come down to Qcom office for next rounds. That day went from 10 to 4 clock break only for lunch.
Round 1 (2 person took from 10 to 12.30):
Round 2 (coding):
Round 3 (coding):
Round 4:
Round 5 (Manager):
Qualcomm aspirations, culture and how you look to be next, feedback from us on the interview, Nothing much… just a casual talk.
 Round 5 (Hr):
Why Qualcomm? Relocation? salary expectation? just a casual talk.
Note: All rounds, you need to explain about your project clearly and they can ask some really good questions from your project. Be out and out clear with your projects and CV.
After this, I was actually into my Dream Company and Happy..!!
I suggest that always listen carefully to an interviewer, they’ll definitely help if you have any doubt. Tell them your approach at least if you are not able to code it. Practice writing code on paper. For Qualcomm Arrays, Linked Lists, Strings and Trees are concepts which are very generally asked. Data structures & algorithms, OS should be proficiently practiced.
I would sincerely Thank GeeksforGeeks very helpful in my preparation and hope this would be useful for other aspirants.
