In this article, we will learn how to print the pattern G using stars and white-spaces. Given a number n, we will write a program to print the pattern G over n lines or rows.
Examples:

In this program, we have used the simple logic of iteration over lines to create the pattern G. Please look at the image below which represents the pattern G in the form of a 2-d matrix, where mat[i][j] = ‘ij’:

If we try to analyze this picture with a (row, column) matrix and the circles represent the position of stars in the pattern G, we will learn the steps. Here we are performing the operations column-wise. So for the first line of stars, we set the first if condition, where the row position with 0 and (n-1) won’t get the stars and all other rows from 1 to (n-1), will get the stars. Similarly, for the second, third and fourth column we want stars at the position row = 0 and row = (n-1). The other steps are self-explanatory and can be understood from the position of rows and columns in the diagram.
Below is the implementation of above idea:
