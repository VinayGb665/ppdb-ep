You have a basketball hoop and someone says that you can play one of two games.
Game1 : You get one shot to make the hoop.
Game2 : You get three shots and you have to make two of three shots.
If p is the probability of making a particular shot, for which values of p should you pick one game or the other?
Answer:
Probability of winning the Game 1:
The probability of winning game 1 is p, by definition.
Probability of winning the Game 2:
Let s(k, n) be the probability of making exactly k shots out of n.The probability of winning the Game 2 is the probability of making exactly two shots out of three OR making all three shots. In other words:
P(winning) = s(2, 3) + s(3, 3)
The probability of making all the three shots is:
The probability of making exactly two shots is:
P(making 1 and 2, & missing 3) + P(making 1 and 3, & missing 2) + P(making 2 and 3, & missing 1)
Adding these together, we get:
Which game you should play?
You should play Game 1 if P(Game 1) > P(Game 2):
Both terms must be positive, or both must be negative, But we know p < 1, so p â€“ 1 < 0. This means both terms must be negative.
So, we should play Game 1 if 0 < p < 0.5 and Game 2 if 0.5 < p < 1.
If p = 0, 0.5, or 1 then P(Game 1) = P(Game 2), so it doesn't matter which game we play.
