Given an infinite stream of integers, find the k’th largest element at any point of time.  It may be assumed that 1 <= k <= n.
Extra space allowed is O(k).
The idea is to use min heap.
1) Store first k elements in min heap.
2) For every element from (k+1)-th to n-th, do following.
……a) Print root of heap.
……b) If current element is more than root of heap, pop root and insert

If stream contains elements of non-primitive types, we may define our own compactor function and create a priority_queue accordingly.
