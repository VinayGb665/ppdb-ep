First Round :  (40min)

included q’s from:time and work,logarithms,clocks,calendars,seating arrangement,percentages,letter and symbol sequences,letter coding and decoding,odd one out
20 MCQs – Technical basics – mostly from C (pointers,operators,macros), program complexity,other programming basics.
Second Round (Technical):
1) Given a string ,find the longest sub-string with all distinct characters in it.If there are multiple such strings,print them all.
	-O(n) solution was expected.
2) Find all common elements in given 3 sorted arrays.
	-O(n) time & no extra space.
3) Print given matrix in a spiral form
	-Tested for all corner cases.
4) Few basics like ACID properties,what is normalization, why do we do it? etc.
5) Asked to write a program to print the following pattern , if n=5: 
and generalize it for all n.
