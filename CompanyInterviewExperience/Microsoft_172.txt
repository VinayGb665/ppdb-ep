Microsoft came for Full Time IDC recruitment in our campus.

Some Questions asked to my Friends –
 
Out of 25 only 2 are selected by Microsoft IDC. I was not one of them. Most of us are eliminated after First Technical Interview.
In coding round the selection is based on time taken to make the code (Since codes are easy). Mine were not efficient. So try to complete as early as possible.
