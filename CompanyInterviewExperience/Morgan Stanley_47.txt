Technical Interview 1 :
The interviewer discussed the codes I wrote.
And some additional questions like queue using two stacks , complexity of BFS, worst case complexity of quick sort and when does the worst case occur.

Out of 22, 10 were shortlisted.
After this, there was no elimination till the end.
