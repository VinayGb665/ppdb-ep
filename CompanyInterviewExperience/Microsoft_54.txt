I had got a call through Naukri Portal . I got interview invite for a weekend drive. 
Round 1 
Hacker rank test :
Q1 : Given relationship of child-parent for a tree for all nodes. Find the diameter of that tree.
Q2 :  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-difference-between-two-elements/
3 more MCQs in test. 
Round: 2
Q1: Given a n-ary tree. Find the longest path (top to down) with consecutive integers in increasing order
Q2: Design a RangeSet class where you can Add, Delete and search in a optimized way
E.g. add 10-20
Delete 13-27
Add – 23-28
Search (3)- output false
Search (22) –  output false
Search (24) – output true
Round: 3 
Q1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/
Q2: Given a tree find the next right element towards any given element in input (Level order traversal)
Q3: Count all possible distinct sums (top-down) in a binary tree.
Round 4: 
Q1: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nuts-bolts-problem-lock-key-problem/
Q2: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming-set-27-max-sum-rectangle-in-a-2d-matrix/
Q3: Given 2 trees, check whether Tree A contains Tree B. (Contains mean all nodes and orientation of their children should match)
Round 5: 
Q1: Given a string like below, it has words embedded for zero to nine, You need to calculate the sum as per the string 
onehhhtwominusthreehhkkseveneightjnine
should be equivalent to
1+2-3+78+9
output: 87
twothreekkkminuspponeksevenoeightllninenine
should be equivalent to
23-1+7+8+99
Output : 136
onetwothreefour
output: 1234
Q2: Design a tiny URL service like bit.ly
Q3: one puzzle :
Given 1 Box with 2 latches
A and B stay in different states.
A has 2 keys of latch 1
B has 2 keys of latch 2
Now user A has to send a message in a box to User B.
while sending the message A has to make sure that no one on the way reads the message. If A sends the Key along, anyone can open it and check .
How would you make sure that this threat to read the message in between, is removed. 
It was a good experience, although i got reject after a few days
