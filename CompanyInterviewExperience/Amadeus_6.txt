Hello all,

First round:

All kind of technical questions will be asked in this round (Based on info in your resume!).
They wan’t to check your approach to given problem.
Tip: “Make the best out of this round, as this owns much weightage on your evaluation!” (My observation!)
After this round, 4 of us were left.
Third Round:
As it was mentioned in the previous experience, The person on the other side of table will look most disinterested.
Try and stay as enthusiastic as you can, don’t get distracted with his/her expressions. Interviewer is just trying to build some pressure.
So maintain your calm and be yourself! You can expect questions on your projects, scenarios that reflect your abilities, etc.
Fourth Round:
It was HR round. Questions like “What keeps you going?” “What value will you add to our company?” etc can be asked.
Be confident in what you say and rest will be taken care of. (Confidence is different from Arrogance! Make sure you sound like former :P)
