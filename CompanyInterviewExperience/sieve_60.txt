Given two numbers N and K. We need to find out if ‘N’ can be written as sum of ‘K’ prime numbers.
Given N <= 10^9
Examples :

The idea is to use Goldbach’s conjecture which says that every even integer (greater than 2) can be expressed as sum of two primes.
If the N = 2K and K = 1 : the answer will be Yes iff N is a prime number
If N >= 2K and K = 2 : If N is an even number answer will be Yes(Goldbach’s conjecture) and if N is odd answer will be No if N-2 is not a prime number and Yes if N-2 is a prime number. This is because we know odd + odd = even and even + odd = odd. So when N is odd, and K = 2 one number must be 2 as it is the only even prime number so now the answer depends whether N-2 is odd or not.
If N >= 2K and K >= 3 :  Answer will always be Yes. When N is even N – 2*(K-2) is also even so N – 2*(K – 2) can be written as sum of two prime numbers (Goldbach’s conjecture) p, q and N can be written as 2, 2 …..K – 2 times, p, q. When N is odd N – 3 -2*(K – 3) is even so it can be written as sum of two prime numbers p, q and N can be witten as 2, 2 …..K-3 times, 3, p, q
