Given a string str of size n. The problem is to print all the palindromic permutations of str in alphabetic order if possible else print “-1”.
Examples :

Prerequisites: Lexicographically first palindromic string and Next higher palindromic number using the same set of digits.
Approach: Following are the steps:
Note that the string str is always manipulated so as to get the palindromic strings using the steps mentioned above.
