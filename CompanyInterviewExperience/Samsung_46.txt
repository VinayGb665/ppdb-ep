Round 1: Online coding round
There is dedicated Samsung software for coding test the question is given below:
There is one spaceship. X and Y co-odinate of source of spaceship and destination spaceship is given. There are N number of warmholes each warmhole has 5 values.
First 2 values are starting co-ordinate of warmhole and after that value no. 3 and 4 represents ending co-ordinate of warmhole and last 5th value is represents cost to pass through this warmhole. Now these warmholes are bi-direction.
Now the to go from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2) is abs(x1-x2)+abs(y1-y2).
The main problem here is to find minimum distance to reach spaceship from source to destination co-ordinate using any number of warm-hole. It is ok if you wont use any warmhole.
Solution:
You can make graph which contain edge between all points and put cost of that edge. Now apply dijstra algorithm to find minimum distace between source to destination co-ordinate of spaceship.
Here the main catch is that the cost to pass through warmhole can be zero so you have to take care while making graph matrix.
After this round 3 are shortlisted out of 60.
Round 2:Technical Round on SkyPe.
-Tell me about yourself.
-I have done project in Android so he asked me the difference between activity and fragment.
-what is the difference between process and thread and some detain question about thread.
-what process scheduler do,type of scheduler and its algorithm.
-find path in matrix with min. cost staring from left upper corner to right bottom corner.

-topological sorting of graph

-You have 1 TB of big file containing numbers and you have to find to N smallest number.
Round 3:HR Round
