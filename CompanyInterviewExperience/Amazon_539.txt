5-quant,  15 technical,  (no verbal reasoning and English).
1) Given 2 binary trees check if it  is symmetric (structure only not data).
2) Remove duplicates in a string in O(n) time (order of input must be preserved)
Round-1

2. Advantages of heaps over arrays.
3. Find 2nd min element from given array
4. Given an array and a sum s find all pairs of numbers which whoose sum=s
(assume array is already sorted)space complexity-O(1),time complexity-O(n)
Round-2
1. Given a tree construct a mirror tree and return root of mirror tree.
2. Level order traversal of a tree.
3. Given a stack output a sorted stack.(hint use recursion).
Round-3
