Given a singly linked list, Your task is to remove every K-th node of the linked list. Assume that K is always less than or equal to length of Linked List.
Examples :

The idea is traverse the list from beginning and keep track of nodes visited after last deletion. Whenever count becomes k, delete current node and reset count as 0.
Below is C++ implementation.
