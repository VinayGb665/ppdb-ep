There is a given binary matrix, we need to find if there exists any rectangle or square in the given matrix whose all four corners are equal to 1.
Examples:

Brute Force Approach-
We start scanning the matrix whenever we find a 1 at any index then we  try for all the combination for index with which we can form the rectangle.

Efficient Approach 
– Scan from top to down, line by line
– For each line, remember each combination of 2 1’s and push that into a hash-set
– If we ever find that combination again in a later line, we get our rectangle
