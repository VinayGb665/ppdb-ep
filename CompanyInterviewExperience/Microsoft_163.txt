Microsoft came to our campus to recruit FTEs for MS-IDC. The selection procedure involved a total of 5 rounds, at the end of which 5 candidates were selected.
Round 1 – Online Coding Round
The first round consisted of 3 coding questions on Cocubes with a time limit of 75 minutes. Only the function body had to be coded.
Round 2 – Group fly
This was a written round with 2 questions.
Give test cases for the above request-response query.
Example, a base case could be fetching data from a file on the server and comparing the data with the local copy of the same file.
Technical Interview – 3 rounds
My first round was a design round. I was given 3 scenarios.
My second round had 2 coding questions
Last Round
The last round had a very simple question. Given a string, report if the string contains all unique characters or not. We were asked to write industry level code and provide test cases as well.
I would like to thank geeksforgeeks.org for providing such exceptional placement support. I did all my preparation from the website alone.
