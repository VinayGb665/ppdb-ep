1. First he asked me to design the database for food shop, then he asked me to minimize the complexity of database and then he asked me some DBMS Query related to Join Operation.
2. Given a Sorted array in which all elements are repeated except one element. Find non repeated element in O (log n).
3. Some Questions On DNS server and IP address.
4. What is cache Memory? What is TLB? And uses?

5. O (2^n), O (n!) Which one complexity is better and why? Prove mathematically.
6. How Hashing works? Why its complexity is always O (1).
7. Again he asked about my Project.

Fifth Round (HR round) 20 min
1. Tell me about yourself?
