Given a positive integer n, we have to find the total number of divisors for n.
Examples:
We have discussed different approaches for printing all divisors (here and here). Here task is simpler, we need to count divisors.
First of all store all primes from 2 to max_size in an array so that we should only check for the prime divisors. Now we will only wish to calculate the factorization of n in following form :
 n = (a1^p1) * (a2^p2) *…….*(an^pn), where a1, a2…an all are prime factors and p1, p2, .. pn are integral power of them as pi being integral power of ai in factorization of n.
So, for this factorization we have formula to find total number of divisor of n and that is:
(p1+1) * (p2+1) *….*(pn+1).
