I attended the HONEYWELL campussing on in JANUARY, it was a campussing only for EIE Stream, all TECHNO INDIA GROUP colleges were invited, it was held in TECHNO INDIA,RAGARHAT.
The campussing consisted of the following:
1. Written Test
2. Technical interview
3. Hr interview
The Written test consisted of 2 parts: technical knowledge and reasoning.
There were 40-50 technical questions ,multiple choice of 1 mark each and 5-6 reasoning questions of 5 mark each.
The subjects on which the technical questions came from were
A) INDUSTRIAL INSTRUMENTATION
B) SENSORS AND TRANSDUCERS
C) PROCESS CONTROL
D) MICROPROCESSORS
And no questions came from other subjects in technical part.As for reasoning,all the questions came from previous question papers .
Unfortunately I didnt got through the Writen test.
As I heard, the  technical questions mainly came PROCESS CONTROL especially PLC AND DCS.
