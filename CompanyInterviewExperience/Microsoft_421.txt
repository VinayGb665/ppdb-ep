Given pointer to the head node of a linked list, the task is to reverse the linked list.  We need to reverse the list by changing links between nodes.
Examples: 
Iterative Method 
// Now change next of current
// This is where actual reversing happens
curr->next = prev 
// Move prev and curr one step forward
prev = curr
curr = next
