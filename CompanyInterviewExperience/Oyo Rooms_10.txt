Oyo rooms came for campus placement in our college on 17th August.
Online Round: It had 20 MCQ and 2 coding question. Total marks was 161.
30 students out of a total of 150 were selected for the F2F interview.
Round 1: The interviewer was pretty chill, and first made me comfortable. The round begin with usual introduction and then straightaway jumped to DS/Algo questions.
This round lasted around an hour.Â 21 students were selected for the second round.
Round 2: Again I got a friendly interviewer. After introduction I got a very simple question.
After this round many students where told â€˜no further roundsâ€™. It included people who did extremely well and were selected, and also the oneâ€™s who werenâ€™t selected. The rest around 10-12 including me were asked to wait, in case of further round.
Round 3: It had only 1 question
Suppose in a social network like FB, where I have a friend, and my further my friends have friends and so on. And each person likes some books.
Q1. Given a person, return the books he likes.
Q2. Return k most liked books in the network.
I was confused wheter I had to design DB for this kind of situation or it was a system design question, or if I had to choose DS for different things. the interviewer clarified â€˜I had to code itâ€™.
So I told the various data structures I would use for storing these, like max-heap for book like count, so that I get k most liked books in O(k) once the heap is built. Next he asked me to write code for this approach.
13 students were selected and unfortunately I wasnâ€™t. And I am still interviewing for other companies for my first job! ðŸ˜›
Tip: OYO Rooms interview are heavilly inclined towards DS/Algo, prepare all the previously asked interview questions specially from Binary Tree and DP.
