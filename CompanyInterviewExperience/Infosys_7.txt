THE SIX MATCHES : Shown in the sketch are six matchsticks:

Can you rearrange them to make nothing?
Solution: The puzzle is to make something from the 6 matches which represents nothing. We have to arrange the 6 matches in some particular order like the mention below:

RIGHT FOOT FORWARD : A short man takes three steps to a tall manâ€™s two steps. They both start out on the left foot. How many steps do they have to take before they are both stepping out on the right foot together?
Solution: The exact answer is they will never step out with right feet together, if both the people take equal steps. But if there is a difference between the steps taken from both the persons then we find that after 3 steps for tall man and 5 steps for short man, the right foot of both together as follows:
Tall : 0 L R L R
Short: 0 L R L R L R
