Amdocs visited our college to recruit for the role of Software Engineering Associate. The selection procedure consisted of 1 online round and 3 F2F interview rounds.
Online Round:
The Online Round was conducted in an exam portal made by Amdocs. The Exam was of a duration of 120 minutes and it had questions from following topics:
More than 150 students appeared for the Online Test and 23 among them were selected for further interview rounds.
Interview Rounds:
He then asked me if I was comfortable in Data Structures or not. I answered yes and was asked the following questions :
1. What is a Linked List?
2. How many types of Linked Lists are there?
3. Write a program to find the first non-repeating character in a given string using C++ or Java syntax. (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/given-a-string-find-its-first-non-repeating-character/).
Lastly he asked me few questions on DBMS:
1. What is Normalisation? Why do we need it?
2. What is redundancy?
3. What is Self Join? Explain with an example. Write the SQL query for it.
He thanked me and the round came to an end. During the whole of the round, the interviewer was very helpful and rather than looking for theoretical answers he directed me to a path so that I can answer based on concept. For this round if you have kept your basics clear and have good and decent knowledge in Programming and other CS fundamental subjects then it will help you a lot to crack the round.

After all the rounds the result was declared and 7 people got selected. Thankfully I was one of them. I would like to thank GeeksforGeeks for being a constant guide for my placement preparation.
