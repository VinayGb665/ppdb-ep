Given two strings string1 and string2, find the smallest substring in string1 containing all characters of string2 efficiently.
For Example:

Method 1 ( Brute force solution )
1- Generate all substrings of string1 (“this is a test string”)
2- For each substring, check whether the substring contains all characters of string2 (“tist”)
3- Finally, print the smallest substring containing all characters of string2.
 
Method 2 ( Efficient Solution )
