Given a number N. The task is to find the sum of all the prime divisors of N. 
Examples:
A naive approach will be to iterate for all numbers till N and check if the number divides N. If the number divides N, check if that number is prime or not. Add all the prime numbers till N which divides N. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach:

Efficient Approach : The complexity can be reduced using Sieve of Eratosthenes with some modifications. The modifications are as follows:
