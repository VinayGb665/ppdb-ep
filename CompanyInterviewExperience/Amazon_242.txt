Given N point on a 2D plane as pair of (x, y) co-ordinates, we need to find maximum number of point which lie on the same line.
Examples:

    We can solve above problem by following approach – For each point p, calculate its slope with other points and use a map to record how many points have same slope, by which we can find out how many points are on same line with p as their one point. For each point keep doing the same thing and update the maximum number of point count found so far.
Some things to note in implementation are:
1) if two point are (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) then their slope will be (y2 – y1) / (x2 – x1) which can be a double value and can cause precision problems. To get rid of the precision problems, we treat slope as pair ((y2 – y1), (x2 – x1)) instead of ratio and reduce pair by their gcd before inserting into map. In below code points which are vertical or repeated are treated separately.
2)  If we use unordered_map in c++ or HashMap in Java for storing the slope pair, then total time complexity of solution will be O(n^2)
