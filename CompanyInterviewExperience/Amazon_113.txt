Recently I had an interview at amazon for SDE 2 role and here is my experience:
Round 1:
1. Given a binary tree, print the nodes in zig-zag form.

2. Given a binary tree, return the farthermost nodes.
Round 2:
1. Implement meeting booking system like outlook.
Round 3:
This was bar-raiser round.
1.  Millions of words are coming in stream and there is a typo in some words.Assign each words in some cluster which is most closer to the word. Example: iphone, ipone, abiphone, iphoe should be in one cluster.
2. Design Data warehouse placement system.
Lots of behavioral questions: why amazon,what is most critical feedback you got from manager, when did you get above and beyond feedback and why.
Round 4:
Detail discussion on project which I have worked on.At each point interviewer was asking why you did this way, why not some other way.
Design producer/consumer live and offline video streaming system.
Design comment system.
Lots of behavioral questions
Round 5:
1. Return all the possible decoding of the given digit sequence where 1 denotes a, 2 -> b, 3->c so on. Example: input 121 output ‘aba’, ‘la’, ‘au’.
