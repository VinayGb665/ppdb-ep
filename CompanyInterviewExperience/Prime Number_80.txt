We are given a number n. Our task is to check whether the number is circular prime or not.
Circular Prime : A prime number is said to be a circular prime if after any cyclic permutations of the digits, it remains a prime.
Examples:

The idea is simple, we generate all permutations of given number and check each permutation for prime. To generate permutations, we one by one move last digit to first position.

Optimizations:
Clearly numbers containing 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 8 can never be circular primes as numbers ending with these will always be divisible by 2 or 5. Hence one of their permutation will not be a prime.  While counting digits in first step, we can also check if current digit is one of these.
