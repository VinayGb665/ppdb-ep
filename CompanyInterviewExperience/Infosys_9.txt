Given an array, the task is to reverse the array without using subtract sign ‘-‘ anywhere in your code. It is not tough to reverse an array but the main thing is to note use ‘-‘ operator.

Below are different approaches: 
Method 1: 
1- Store array elements into a vector in C++.
2- Then reverse the vector using predefined functions.
3- Then store reversed elements into the array back.
Method 2: 
1- Store array elements into a stack.
2- As the stack follows Last In First Out, so we can store elements from
    top of the stack into the array which will be itself in a reverse manner. 
Method 3:
1- In this method the idea is to use negative sign but by storing it into a variable.
2- By using this statement x = (INT_MIN/INT_MAX), we get -1 in a variable x.
3- As INT_MIN and INT_MAX have same values just of opposite signs,so on dividing them it will give -1.
4- Then ‘x’ can be used in decrementing the index from last.

 Method 4:
In this method 4, the idea is to use bitwise operator to implement subtraction i.e.
 A – B = A + ~B + 1
so, i– can be written as i = i +~1 +1
