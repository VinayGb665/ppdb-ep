Panel 2
I would like to make point clear here that if you don’t know much about a project in your resume don’t ever put it there, I learnt it the hard way in this round.
1. Questions about my Dbms project which I really didn’t do myself?
2. Questions about css and php in my project description which I couldn’t answer.
3. He asked me to draw the table I used in my project.I got stuck and he found that I didn’t do the project?

I got pretty nervous, then he advised me to do more teamwork.
