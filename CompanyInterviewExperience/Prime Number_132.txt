Given a number n, check if it is prime or not. We have introduced and discussed School and Fermat methods for primality testing.
Primality Test | Set 1 (Introduction and School Method)
Primality Test | Set 2 (Fermat Method)
In this post, Miller-Rabin method is discussed. This method is a probabilistic method (Like Fermat), but it generally preferred over Fermatâ€™s method.
