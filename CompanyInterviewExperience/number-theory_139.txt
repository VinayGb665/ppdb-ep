Pell numbers are numbers that are similar to the Fibonacci numbers and are generated by below formula
First few Pell numbers are 0, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860, 33461, …. 
Write a function int pell(int n) that returns Pn.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Extra Space: O(1)
Using matrix calculation:
This another O(n) which relies on the fact that if we n times multiply the matrix M = {{2, 1}, {1, 0}} to itself (in other words calculate power(M, n )), then we get the (n+1)th Pell number as the element at row and column (0, 0) in the resultant matrix.


Time Complexity : Since we can compute n-th power of a 2 x 2 matrix in O(log n) time, time complexity of this solution is O(log n)
