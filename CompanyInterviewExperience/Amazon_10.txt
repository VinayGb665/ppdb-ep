Round 1: Coding round + MCQs
 
There were 2 coding questions and 20 mcqs of variable marks such as 4, 6 and 2 and no negative marking.
Question 1- Stock span problem
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/the-stock-span-problem/
Question 2- Zig-Zag traversal.  The only catch was the tree was given in the form of array like 3, 2, 4, 5, null, null, 1, 1, 2, 12. All internal nodes would have either a value or null. Leaves could be empty. It was more of implementation tester.
24 students were shortlisted. (Mostly based on MCQs because the coding was done by many ).
Round 2: Tech Round (Purely based on GeeksForGeeks DSA)

I was asked about the test and how I solved the questions. Then I was asked https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-profit-by-buying-and-selling-a-share-at-most-twice/ . First I was asked my algorithm and then I was asked to code it all on paper.
Then he asked about my hobbies.
13 Students made it to Round 3.
Round 3: Tech Round ( GeeksForGeeks and Problem solving skills tester )

Given a graph create a tree with minimum depth. I was not asked to write the code but the discussion went on for about 5 to 10 mins.
Then I was asked https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/median-of-stream-of-integers-running-integers/ .
Next question was LCA in a Binary Tree.
Then using that solution find Distance between two nodes A and B.
Then swap alternate elements in the Linkedlist.
 
Finally after a whole day of Process 9 Students were selected for Internship and I was One of Them.
