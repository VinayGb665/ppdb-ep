Recently I attended the Amazon walk-in and got selected for the position of SDE I.
Written test: 
1. Write a code to convert tree to DDL(assume tree node contains pre, next pointers and set as null intially.)
2. WAP to encode and decode string.
        aabbbbcccd  a2b4c3d1
3. Find the sum of elements in after nth iteration for below operation on array. 
Hiring Manager:
1. Find the nearest leaf node from given node in binary tree..
      use post order traversal.. like LCA in binary tree
2. Find the first k largest numbers from large file size. Explain solution for 
           1. When we have space to store K elements in RAM
            2. When we didn’t have space to store K elements in RAM
Tech:
1. Design N-ary tree, to make sure that lock and unlock operations can be done with minimum complexity (height of tree)
      a node can be locked when its ancestors or successor are not locked.
      we can a unlock a node a any time.
2. a[] = {a,b,c,d,e} b[]={f,g,h} result should be = af+bg+ch+df+eg
Tech:
1. Find maximum product of subarray in given array of integers
2. Design T9 dictionary
Bar Riser:
1. Design a tree, in which a root can have unlimited children and write a code to print each level in separate level
2. Print the anagrams present in a huge file (each line in file contains one word and you didn’t have any constraints like limited memory etc..) for a give string
      use trie or hashmap
Like all Amazon interviews in GFG, here interviewer more concerned about edge cases and perf perf perf perfect code.
Thanks a lot GEEKS FOR GEEKS  and my dear friends Ramesh, Purush, Jhadey for helping me in preparation.
