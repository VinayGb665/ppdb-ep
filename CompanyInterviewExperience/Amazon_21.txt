Given an array of N integers where Ai denotes the currency of note that the i-th person has. The possible currencies are 5, 10 and 20. All the N people are standing in a queue waiting to buy an ice-cream from X which costs Rs 5. Initially, X has an initial balance of 0. Check if X will be able to provide change to every people who are waiting to buy an ice-cream. 
Examples:
Input:a[] =  {5, 5, 5, 10, 20}
Output: YES
When the fourth person chance comes to buy an ice-cream, X has three Rs 5
change, hence X gives him 1, and now when the fifth person
comes to buy the ice-cream, X has two Rs 5 and one Rs 10 note, hence he
gives him one Rs 10 and one Rs 5 note. 
Input: a[] = {5, 10, 10, 20}
Output: NO
The approach is to keep a track of the number of Rs 5 and Rs 10 currencies. Rs 20 currencies will not be used since it is the highest currency that a person can give and thus it cannot be given as a change. Initialize two variables to count Rs 5(fiveCount) and Rs 10(tenCount). If the person has a Rs 10 currency and fiveCount > 0, then decrease fiveCount and increase tenCount. If X does not have Rs 5, then X cannot give the person the required change. If the person has 5$ note, increase fiveCount by one. If the person has a Rs 20, then three conditions will be: 
If all the person in the queue gets the change, then print “YES” else print “NO”. 
Below is the implementation of the above idea.
