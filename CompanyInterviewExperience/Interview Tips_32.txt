We have been trying to organize content of geeksforgeeks. We added below pages for this purpose.
Algorithms and Data Structures:
Languages:
Interview:
Students:
GATE, ISRO, and UGC NET exam preparation:
Computer Science subjects:
Other subjects:
Courses and Test exams:
The above pages contain all related article at one place, but do not provide proper navigation through articles. GeeksforGeeks is quite limited in functionalities which motivated the team to design GeeksforGeeks Courses.  The idea of https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/courses, is to allow users to see/navigate content in an organized manner, to enroll into different courses and track their progress. We will be adding more features over time. 
We are also planning to cover more areas/topics which are not currently covered on GeeksforGeeks. Stay tuned!
