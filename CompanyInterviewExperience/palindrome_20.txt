Given two positive integers N, M. The task is to find the number of strings of length N under the alphabet set of size M such that no substrings of size greater than 1 is palindromic.
Examples:

First, observe, a string does not contain any palindromic substring if the string doesnâ€™t have any palindromic substring of the length 2 and 3, because all the palindromic string of the greater lengths contains at least one palindromic substring of the length of 2 or 3, basically in the center.
So, the following is true:
Knowing this, we can evaluate the answer in the following ways:
