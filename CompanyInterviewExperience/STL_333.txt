Vectors  are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container.
clear() function is used to remove all the elements of the vector container, thus making it size 0.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. It has a no exception throw guarantee.
2. Shows error when a parameter is passed.
Run on IDE
Output:
erase() function is used to remove elements from a container from the specified position or range.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. It has a no exception throw guarantee, if the position is valid.
2. Shows undefined behaviour otherwise.
Removing element from particular position
Run on IDE
Output:
Removing elements within a range
Run on IDE
Output:
Application
Given a list of integers, remove all the even elements from the vector and print the vector.
Algorithm
1. Run a loop till the size of the vector.
2. Check if the element at each position is divisible by 2, if yes, remove the element and decrement iterator.
3. Print the final vector.
Run on IDE
Output:
clear() removes all the elements from a vector container, thus making its size 0. All the elements of the vector are removed using clear() function.
erase() function on the other hand, is used to remove specific elements from the container or a range of elements from the container, thus reducing its size by the number of elements removed.
