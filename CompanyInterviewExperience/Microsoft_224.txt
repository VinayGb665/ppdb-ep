Hi, Following is my interview experience for SDE position in Bing Team.
– Online Round :
           Total questions 2.
    The question was big, like a story but it ultimately boils down to Longest Common Subsequence.
– Onsite : Round 1 : Duration around 1 hour
    Given a binary tree, connect all node in the same level. Node structure is : left, right, data, next. Each level next should point to the next right node in the level. For last node in each level, next should be NULL
– Onsite : Round 2 :
–  Onsite : Round 3:
    Discussion about previous work. Challenges faced.
– Onsite Round 4: With Bing team GM

Overall, it was a great experience. Great food and snacks throughout the day. The interviewers were friendly, giving hints and all. I would also like to thank geeksforgeeks for being there always. I have been greatly benefited hence I am taking time in sharing a detailed and thorough description of the process from my perspective.
