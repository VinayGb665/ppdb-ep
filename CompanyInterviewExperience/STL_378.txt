Converts the value ch to unsigned char and copies it into each of the first n characters of the object pointed to by str[]. If the object is not trivially-copyable (e.g., scalar, array, or a C-compatible struct), the behavior is undefined. If n is greater than the size of the object pointed to by str, the behavior is undefined.
