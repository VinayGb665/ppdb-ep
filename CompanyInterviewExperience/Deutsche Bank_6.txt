Interview Round
The interview round of two colleges was arranged on the same day. There were approximately 55 students in this round. Overall interview experience was good. All interviewers were so supportive and encouraging. But, the whole process was so lengthy.
It took them 2.5 hrs to take the decision. They selected totally 13 students for the offer letter. Out of which I was the one who was selected.
Thanks to geeksforgeeks. Its aptitude questions helped me a lot.
