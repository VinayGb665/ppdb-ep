Given N numbers which have a permutation of first N numbers. In a single operation, any prefix can be reversed. The task is to find the minimum number of such operations such that the numbers in the array are in increasing order. 
Examples:
The approach to solve this problem is to use BFS. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach:
