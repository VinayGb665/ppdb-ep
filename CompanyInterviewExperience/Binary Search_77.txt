Given a sorted array of n distinct integers rotated at some point. Given a value x. The problem is to count all the elements in the array which are less than or equal to x.
Examples:

Naive Approach: One by one traverse all the elements of the array and count the one’s which are less than or equal  to x. Time Complexity O(n).
Efficient Approach: Prerequisite of a modified binary search which can return the index of the largest element smaller than or equal to a given value in a sorted range of arr[l…h].
