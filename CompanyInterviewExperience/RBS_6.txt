Round 1: This was a written pen and paper round with 20 MCQ questions (related to Java as I applied for Java developer) and 4 coding questions out of which three needed to be done on paper

Find the row with highest no. of 1 in a 2d sorted matrix having 0 and 1 as column values
Reverse a linked list recursively
Rwo roads and only one sided traffic at a time is allowed. Code for synchronization to avoid deadlock

Round 3: Was a Design round of one hour on pen and paper Both HIGH and LOW level design was asked .

Design a system which could have N clients .Each client can be charged with M prices depending upon P number of services.
System should have following characteristics
N can always be increased or decreased
M can always be increased or decreased like (hotel prices) so a variable pricing scheme need to be implemented
Services can also increase or decrease
System could Serve millions of customer at a time
System should be scalable and fault tolerant.
The requested should be served as fast as possible minimizing space.
Round 4 : technical discussion of design Round
Cache implementation .
Hashmap implementation .
Data structure implementation which could store only duplicates
Implementing a service in which a task  is done by 10 threads parallely and we have to update task progress of each thread in overall progress like a file download manager
