Recently had a interview with Amazon, through employee referral.  All face to face rounds. I didn’t clear, so no offer. 🙁
1st Technical  Round:
Given an integer, find the next biggest integer whose digits are in increasing order.
Example:
Input: 118
Output: 123
Input: 127
Output: 234
Input: 987
Output: 1234
Designing question: Design a parking space to park a car.
2nd Manager Round:
Explain my current project. Architecture and design flows etc. asked.
Any challenges while working on the project.
Any glitches/cases where you completed got it wrong etc.
After two rounds asked to leave. I guess I didn’t answer as per standards.
Thanks anyways GeeksForGeeks.
