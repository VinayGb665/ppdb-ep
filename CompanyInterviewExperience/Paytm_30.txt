3. Given a file which contains currency conversion rates for many countries. Write an algorithm to validate this file and make sure there is no mistake in the file. In case of any mistake, print the line number.
For example â€“
1. USD â€“ INR â€“ 50
2.. GBP â€“ USD â€“ 100
3. GBP â€“ INR â€“ 3
Here, GBP â€“ INR should have been 2, and not 3. Hence this is a mistake and the program should output Line 3 as output.
4. Questions on Angular JS and Core Javascropt.
No HR Round conducted.
