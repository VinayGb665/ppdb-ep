Given a Binary Tree and a positive integer k, print all nodes that are distance k from a leaf node. 
Here the meaning of distance is different from previous post.  Here k distance from a leaf means k levels higher than a leaf node.  For example if k is more than height of Binary Tree, then nothing should be printed.  Expected time complexity is O(n) where n is the number nodes in the given Binary Tree.

The idea is to traverse the tree. Keep storing all ancestors till we hit a leaf node.  When we reach a leaf node, we print the ancestor at distance k.  We also need to keep track of nodes that are already printed as output. For that we use a boolean array visited[].

Time Complexity: Time Complexity of above code is O(n) as the code does a simple tree traversal.
