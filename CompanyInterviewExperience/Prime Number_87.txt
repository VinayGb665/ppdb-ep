Every programmer comes across the problem of checking whether a number is prime and indeed it’s one of the basic level program in any language. I also tried it in many different languages, but the best language that I found to implement it is Python. It’s just one single line and the program does it all. Its so simple and smooth than other languages. 
The concept of Any and All has really reduced this problem to a single line and yes it is fast too.
The logic used in this program is based on school method to check prime.
