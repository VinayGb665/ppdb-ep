Given a number N. The task is to print all possible sums of consecutive numbers that add up to N.
Examples :

One important fact is we can not find consecutive numbers above N/2 that adds up to N, because N/2 + (N/2 + 1) would be more than N. So we start from start = 1 till end = N/2 and check for every consecutive sequence whether it adds up to N or not. If it is then we print that sequence and start looking for the next sequence by incrementing start point.

Optimized Solution:
In above solution, we keep recalculating sums from start to end, which results in O(N^2) worst case time complexity. This can be avoided by using a precomputed array of sums, or better yet â€“ just keeping track of the sum you have so far and adjusting it depending on how it compares to the desired sum.
Time complexity of below code is O(N).
