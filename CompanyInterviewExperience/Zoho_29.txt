First, I would like to thank geekforgeeks for providing me with the previous interview questions. 
I applied through employee referral. First round was held at a college in Thirunelveli on 8th January, 2017. It consisted of 20 C aptitude questions and 10 general aptitude questions. These questions concentrated on control flows. Good knowledge in loops and recursions is enough to clear this round. Since the questions were in C, We need to know the basics of pointers as well. Around 5000 people attended this round. And only around 50 people were selected for further rounds.
Second and third round, We were asked to solve simple algorithm questions. People who didn’t do well were sent out on the spot. Questions were from Arrays and String manipulation. Around 10 people cleared this round.
Fourth round was technical HR. Since I am from Automobile Stream, He didn’t ask many questions in coding. He asked a few puzzles. He was nice and helped me solve the puzzles. 
Then I was sent to general HR. She asked why Zoho? Why didn’t I try to get a job in the past 8 months after the completion of my degree? And salary Expectations. After this round They told me that they will contact me in two days.
I was informed on 14th January that I got the job.
