Round2:-
a) You are given an array containing only 3 type of characters let say a,b,c write a program to sort the array having these. Eg abcaacbbaaaaccc sort it. I gave standard 3 flag solution then he asked you are complicating it you can use other method then I gave counting method.He asked me to compare the complexity of both methods.then discuss leads to while calculating complexity we compare number of iteration only or total calculation in the program.
then he asked if we have let say k type of character then which method is good the count one or three flag one.
b) Implement T9 dictionary. how T9 works is : let say if I press 223 it should give all the possible valid words in suggestion Eg bad,cad,aad etc. give datastructure to store valid words etc.
