Given a Linked List and a number n, write a function that returns the value at the n’th node from end of the Linked List.
For example, if input is below list and n = 3, then output is “B”

Method 1 (Use length of linked list)
1) Calculate the length of Linked List.  Let the length be len.
2) Print the (len – n + 1)th node from the begining of the Linked List.

Following is a recursive C code for the same method.  Thanks to Anuj Bansal for providing following code.

Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the length of linked list.
Method 2 (Use two pointers) 
Maintain two pointers – reference pointer and main pointer.  Initialize both reference and main pointers to head.  First move reference pointer to n nodes from head.  Now move both pointers one by one until reference pointer reaches end. Now main pointer will point to nth node from the end. Return main pointer.
