Given two positive integer N, M. The task is to check if N and M are friendly pair or not.

In number theory, friendly pairs are two numbers with a common abundancy index, the ratio between the sum of divisors of a number and the number itself i.e ?(n)/n. S o, two number n and m are friendly number if
 ?(n)/n = ?(m)/m.
where ?(n) is the sum of divisors of n.
Examples:

The idea is to find the sum of divisor of n and m. And to check if the abundancy index of n and m, we will find the Greatest Common Divisors of n and m with their sum of divisors. And check if the reduced form of abundancy index of n and m are equal by checking if their numerator and denominator are equal or not. To find the reduced form, we will divide numerator and denominator by GCD.
Below is the implementation of above idea :
