Given a perfect binary tree, print nodes of middle level without computing its height. A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.

Output : 4 5 6 7
The idea is similar to method 2 of finding middle of singly linked list.
Use fast and slow (or tortoise) pointers in each route of a the tree.
1. Advance fast pointer towards leaf by 2.
2. Advance slow pointer towards lead by 1.
3. If fast pointer reaches the leaf print value at slow pointer
4. Call recursively the next route.
