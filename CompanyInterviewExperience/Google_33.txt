Given three numbers x, y and p, compute (xy) % p.  
Examples :
We have discussed recursive and iterative solutions for power.
Below is discussed iterative solution.

The problem with above solutions is, overflow may occur for large value of n or x.  Therefore, power is generally evaluated under modulo of a large number.
Below is the fundamental modular property that is used for efficiently computing power under modular arithmetic.
Below is the implementation based on above property.
