We are given two arrays num[0..k-1] and rem[0..k-1]. In num[0..k-1], every pair is coprime (gcd for every pair is 1). We need to find minimum positive number x such that: 
Example:
We strongly recommend to refer below post as a prerequisite for this.
Chinese Remainder Theorem | Set 1 (Introduction)
We have discussed a Naive solution to find minimum x.  In this article, an efficient solution to find x is discussed.
The solution is based on below formula.
Example:
Refer this for nice visual explanation of above formula.
Below is the implementation of above formula.  We can use Extended Euclid based method discussed here to find inverse modulo.
