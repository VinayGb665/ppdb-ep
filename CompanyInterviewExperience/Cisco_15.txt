2. What are the osi layers and explain them.
3. What are pointers.
4. A puzzle : We have two pits with capacities of 5 and 4. How will you measure 2 litres of water with these pots.
Soln: Fill 5 litre pot and pour the contents into four litre pot. So we are left with 1litre in 5 litre pot and 4 litres in 4 litre pot. Empty the contents of the four litre pot and pour the contents of 5 litre pot(1 litre) into 4 litre pot. Now again fill the 5 litre pot and pour the contents into the 4 litre pot until it becomes full. So now we have 3+1 lites in four litre pot and 5-3=2 litres in 5 litre pot.
