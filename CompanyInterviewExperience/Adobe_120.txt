Equilibrium index of an array is an index such that the sum of elements at lower indexes is equal to the sum of elements at higher indexes. For example, in an array A: 
Example : 
Write a function int equilibrium(int[] arr, int n); that given a sequence arr[] of size n, returns an equilibrium index (if any) or -1 if no equilibrium indexes exist. 
Method 1 (Simple but inefficient)
Use two loops. Outer loop iterates through all the element and inner loop finds out whether the current index picked by the outer loop is equilibrium index or not.  Time complexity of this solution is O(n^2).

Method 2 (Tricky and Efficient)
The idea is to get total sum of array first. Then Iterate through the array and keep updating the left sum which is initialized as zero. In the loop, we can get right sum by subtracting the elements one by one. Thanks to Sambasiva for suggesting this solution and providing code for this.

As pointed out by Sameer, we can remove the return statement and add a print statement to print all equilibrium indexes instead of returning only one.
