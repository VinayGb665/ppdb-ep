Given a decimal number m, convert it into a binary string and apply n iterations, in each iteration 0 becomes “01” and 1 becomes “10”. Find ith(based indexing) index character in the string after nth iteration.
Examples :


1. Change a decimal number into binary and store in string s.
2. Run loop n times in each iteration. Run another loop of string
   length s to convert 0 to “01” and 1 to “10” and store in another string s1.
   After completion of each iteration, assign string s1 to s.
3. At last Return the value of ith index in string s.
