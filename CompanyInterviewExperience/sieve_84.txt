Emirp is the word “prime” spelled backwards, and it refers to a prime number that becomes a new prime number when you reverse its digits. Emirps do not include palindromic primes (like 151 or 787) nor 1-digit primes like 7.  107, 113, 149, and 157 – reverse them and you’ve got a new prime number on your hands. Source: Wiki

Given a number n, the task is to print all Emrips smaller than or equal to n.
Examples : 
Below are the steps :
1) Use Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate all primes smaller than or equal to n. We can also use sieve of sundaram.
2) Traverse all generated prime numbers. For every traversed prime number print this number and its reverse if following conditions are satisfied.
………….a) If reverse is also prime.
………….b) Reverse is not same as prime (palindromes are not allowed)
………….c) Reverse is smaller than or equal to n.
Below is the implementation of above idea.
