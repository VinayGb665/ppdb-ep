Given a number n, we need to find the product of all prime numbers between 1 to n.
Examples:

Using Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers from 1 to n then compute the product.
Following is the algorithm to find all the prime numbers less than or equal to a given integer n by Eratosthenes’ method:
When the algorithm terminates, all the numbers in the list that are not marked are prime and using a loop we compute the product of prime numbers.
