Given an array of positive integers(may contain duplicates) and a number ‘m’, find the number of unordered triplets ((Ai, Aj, Ak) and (Aj, Ai, Ak) and other permutations are counted as one only) with product equal to ‘m’. 
Examples:
Input: arr[] = { 1, 4, 6, 2, 3, 8}, M = 24
Output: 3
The triplets are {1, 4, 6} {1, 3, 8} {4, 2, 3}
Input: arr[] = { 0, 4, 6, 2, 3, 8}, M = 18
Output: 0
There are no triplets in this case
A solution with O(N2) has been discussed in the previous post. In this post a better approach with lesser complexity has been discussed. 
Approach: The below algorithm is followed to solve the above problem. 
Below is the implementation of the above approach.
