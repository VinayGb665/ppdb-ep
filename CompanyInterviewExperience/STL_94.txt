The legendre , legendref and legendrel are built functions in C++ STL that are used to compute the value of unassociated polynomials of degree n and argument x. Value of order-n unassociated Legendre Polynomial of x is given by :
      
The first few Legendre polynomials are
      
Syntax:
Parameters: The function accepts two mandatory parameters which are described below: 
Return Value: The function returns the value of order-n unassociated Legendre Polynomial for argument x. The return type depends on the parameters passed.
Note: The function runs in and above C++ 17(7.1).
Below program illustrates the above mentioned functions:
