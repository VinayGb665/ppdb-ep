Hello geeks, first of all i would like to thanx to geeksforgeeks.
Guyz, you will understand why i am thanking geeksforgeeks after reading my experience.

First round was coading round. there were two question.
1. Knapsack 0-1 problem.
2. A program related to array and hashing.
I have submitted knapsack 0-1 problem fully. i had learned this algorithm from geeksforgeeks.
second problem i have submitted 50% correctly.
Second round was technical round.
I told that my area of interest is object oriented concepts and I know c++.
so he asked me some of the object oriented concept like
What is encapsulation.
Ways to access private data of a class.
Why Java is developed if c++ is already there.
Is multiple inheritance good if not explain.
How to handle exception if it comes in calling of constructor.
What happens if i have a constructor with one argument but i am creating object without any argument.
Then some DBMS related questions.
Third round was HR round here they pointed out my pg pointers
And they pointed out coding rounds that i have won.
And specially they pointed out that i am campus ambassador of geeksforgeeks
