I received interview call from Microsoft (Bangalore) for CRM team, SDE1 position for 1.5 year experience.
Round 1: 1 hour
It was a GD like interview, with multiple people in same room given same question and interviewer was discussing individually with every person.

I started with brute force approach, then optimized to binary seacrh and then hashmap
Round 2: 1 hour
Same as previous round, one interviewer, multiple candidates same question individual discussion.

Round 4: F2F 1.5 hour
A printed sheet of a c-program was given, had to find syntactical and logical error in program. 
Connect all nodes of a binary tree which are at same level.

Round 5: Hiring Manager <1 hour
Detailed discussion on current work, was grilled a lot

Tips:
Keep thinking loud and discussing your thought process with interviewer. They will keep giving hints for you to reach solution.
Find a solution, any solution, and keep optimizing it.
Hope this helps. ðŸ™‚
