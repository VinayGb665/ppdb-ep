Given an array arr[] of n elements and a number K. The task is to determine if it is possible to reach the end of the array by doing the below operations:
Traverse the given array and,
If it is possible to reach the end of array with (K > 0), then print YES otherwise print NO.
Examples:

Time complexity: O(N(sqrt N))
Efficient Approach: The above approach can be optimized by using Sieve of Eratosthenes to check if a number is prime or not.
Below is the implementation of the efficient approach: 
Run on IDE
Time complexity: O(?Max * loglog(Max)) + O(n)
