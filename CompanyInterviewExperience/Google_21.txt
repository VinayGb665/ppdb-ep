Given a length n, count the number of strings of length n that can be made using ‘a’, ‘b’ and ‘c’ with at-most one ‘b’ and two ‘c’s allowed.
Examples :
Asked in Google Interview

A simple solution  is to recursively count all possible combination of string that can be mode up to latter ‘a’, ‘b’, and ‘c’.

Time complexity of above solution is exponential.
 
Efficient Solution
If we drown a recursion tree of above code, we can notice that same values appear multiple times. So we store results which are used later if repeated.
