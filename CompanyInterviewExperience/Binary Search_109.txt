Given hypotenuse and area of a right angle triangle, get its base and height and if any triangle with given hypotenuse and area is not possible, print not possible.
Examples:


	We can use a property of right angle triangle for solving this problem, which can be stated as follows,
Now if given area is less than this maximum area, we can do a binary search for length of base, as increasing base will increases area, it is a monotonically increasing function where binary search can be applied easily.
	In below code, a method is written for getting area of right angle triangle, recall that for right angle triangle area is Â½*base*height and height can be calculated from base and hypotenuse using pythagorean theorem.
Run on IDE
Output:
One more solution is discussed in below post.
Check if right angles possible from given area and hypotenuse
