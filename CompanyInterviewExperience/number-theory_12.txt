Prerequisites:
Given a value n, and the task is to print pentatope numbers series up to nth term.
Examples:
Method 1: Using Tetrahedral Number Series:
This problem can be easily solved with the fact that Nth Pentatope Number is equal to the sum of first N Tetrahedral numbers.
Letâ€™s have a look on Series of Pentatope and Tetrahedral Numbers.

For n = 5
Tetrahedral Numbers  =  1, 4, 10, 20,   35
Prefix Sum of Tetrahedral numbers for each term: (1), (1 + 4), (1 + 4 + 10),  (1 + 4 + 10 + 20),  (1 + 4 + 10 + 20 + 35)
So, Pentatope numbers are 1, 5, 15, 35,   70

Calculate Nth Tetrahedral number using formula:  
So, print the Pentatope Numbers series by generating tetrahedral numbers and adding it with the sum of all previously generated Tetrahedral Numbers.
