 Online-screening test: It was of around 90 minutes and was divided in 3 individual tests as follows:
Round 1: Technical interview (70 -80 min)
Interviewer asked favorite subjects apart from data structures and algorithms. I told him dbms and oops.
2nd round Tech + HR: (50- 60 min)
Basic HR questions. Where do you see yourself in 5 yrs, why do u want to join Microsoft etc. Print all prime nos from 1 to 100. Design elevator algorithm which responds in least possible time. SQL query to find nth highest salary of an employee. Explain IOT in layman terms, cryptography, software testing methods, how do you handle stress, strategy to study the tough subject, what if we do not select you etc. Discussion on my projects.
3rd round: HR (60 – 65 min)
Tell me about yourself, discussion on my projects, why I used a particular technology in project, what other technology I could choose, asked almost everything from the resume, priorities in life, why Microsoft, what people say about you: positives, negatives and how you are working on it, what if we don’t select you etc. Interviewer was awesome and it was fun talking to him.
My whole experience was amazing. Study DBMS, SQL and data structures thoroughly. Also do give a look at puzzles. If you do not know anything, say no simply. Be confident.
I would like to thanks GeeksforGeeks.org and GeeksQuiz a lot for wonderful collection.
