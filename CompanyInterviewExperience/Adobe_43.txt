You are given a bitonic sequence, the task is to find Bitonic Point in it. A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing.
A Bitonic Point is a point in bitonic sequence before which elements are strictly increasing and after which elements are strictly decreasing. A Bitonic point doesn’t exist if array is only decreasing or only increasing.
Examples :

A simple solution for this problem is to use linear search. Element arr[i] is bitonic point if both i-1’th and i+1’th both elements are less than i’th element. Time complexity for this approach is O(n).
An efficient solution for this problem is to use modified binary search.
