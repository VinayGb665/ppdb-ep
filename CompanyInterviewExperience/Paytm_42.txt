Consider lines of slope -1 passing between nodes. Given a Binary Tree, print all diagonal elements in a binary tree belonging to same line.
The idea is to use map.  We use different slope distances and use them as key in map.  Value in map is vector (or dynamic array) of nodes. We traverse the tree to store values in map. Once map is built, we print contents of it. 
Below is implementation of above idea.
