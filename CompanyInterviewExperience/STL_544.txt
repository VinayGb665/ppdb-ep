We have introduced Graph basics in Graph and its representations.  In this post, a different STL based representation is used that can be helpful to quickly implement graph using vectors. The implementation is for adjacency list representation of graph. 
Following is an example undirected and unweighted graph with 5 vertices.

Below is adjacency list representation of the graph.

We use vector in STL to implement graph using adjacency list representation.
The idea is to to represent graph as an array of vectors such that every vector represents adjacency list of a vertex. Below is complete STL based C++ program for DFS Traversal.
