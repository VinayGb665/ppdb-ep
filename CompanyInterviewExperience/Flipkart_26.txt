Round 1: Coding Round
There were 3 questions to be solved on hackerrank in 90 minutes. Questions were:
24 students were selected based on this round. Need not solve all the problems completely to get selected as hackerrank gives partial marking even if some testcases are not running in a problem.
Round 2: Technical Round( 30 mins)
The interviewer made it clear in the start that he is going to ask 2 questions and I have 30 minutes to solve both the questions.
The interviewer asked me to tell him what I am thinking and was giving hints based on that. 17 were selected after this round.
Round 3: Technical Round (30 mins)
The rules were same as the previous round
Interviewer was expecting solution for both the questions and students who were solving only 1 of 2 were not selected for the next round. 9 were selected after this round
Round 4 : Hiring Manager (45 minutes)
This was a Hr + technical round. First he asked me about my college life, my passion etc. The we discussed my internships in detail. Late he asked my strength, weakness and what is an ideal company to you? He gave me to write a code in Java using OOP. Later asked me advantages of abstarction and interfaces. Later he asked me questions like if I give you 1 million dollar where and how will you use it? We had a deep discussion on it.
I advise you to write beforehand answers to your introduction, weakness, strengths, why should we hire you, why this company, why this college, why this branch, justify your cgpa, why this club/society, why this internship, why this approach in your internship, challenges faced in projects, how you solved them and similar such problems to crack this round.
7 were selected after this round and I was one of them.
