Given a sorted array containing only numbers 0 and 1, the task is to find the transition point efficiently. Transition point is a point where “0” ends and “1” begins.
Examples :
A naive approach is to do a linear scan of an array till you get the first 1 i.e. transition point.
Time Complexity : O(n) as we are performing Linear Search.
An efficient method is to use Binary Search.
