Given a number n, the task is to find the odd factor sum.
Examples :

Prerequisite : Sum of all the factors of a number
As discussed in above mentioned previous post, sum of factors of a number is 
Let p1, p2, … pk be prime factors of n.  Let a1, a2, .. ak be highest powers of p1, p2, .. pk respectively that divide n, i.e., we can write n as n = (p1a1)*(p2a2)* … (pkak).
To find sum of odd factors, we simply need to ignore even factors and their powers.  For example, consider n = 18. It can be written as 2132 and sun of all factors is (1)*(1 + 2)*(1 + 3 + 32). Sum of odd factors (1)*(1+3+32) = 13.
To remove all even factors, we repeatedly divide n while it is divisible by 2. After this step, we only get odd factors. Note that 2 is the only even prime.
