Compute cumulative inner product of range
Returns the result of accumulating init with the inner products of the pairs formed by the elements of two ranges starting at first1 and first2.
The two default operations (to add up the result of multiplying the pairs) may be overridden by the arguments binary_op1 and binary_op2.
1. Using default inner_product :

2. Using functional operation :

3. Using custom functions :
Syntax:
Run on IDE
Output:
NOTE :
By using functional value and custom function, we can perform operation by changing the operator ( or using different functional value) in this STL function.
Possible Application :  It returns the result of accumulating init with the inner products of the pair formed by the elements of two ranges starting at first1 and first2.
1. It can be used to find sum of products of i th index of both arrays.
For Example:
Array 1 : 1 2 3 4
Array 2 : 10 20 30 40
Sum of products : 300
Explanation : 1 * 10 + 2 * 20 + 3 * 30 + 4 * 40 = 300
Run on IDE
OUTPUT :
We can also find the difference of products, or sum of division, or difference of division and more all by changing the operator.
