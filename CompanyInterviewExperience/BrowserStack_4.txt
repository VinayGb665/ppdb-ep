First Round(Telephonic)
Two questions of coding. They were easy to program. A link was shared on my email of google docs.
Questions were :-
1. Return an array of fibonacci sequence 
2. String to number mapping is given find the smallest mapping of number.
 for ex. 1=>a, 2=>b , 3=>c ……………
 input is 234
 find the smallest corresponding to it
 brute force solution was required 
Second round of interview(Telephonic)
1. Basic questions on projects and resume.
2. Basic questions on sql and table like find seconod set of top 10 elements in a table
Third round
Three questions were asked which were tough to handle
1. HTML parser
2. SQL  parser
3. forgot but something on parser
HTML parser
A long file was given and we have to find the given html response code and the count of the code in the file 
SQL parser
A long file with data about the table formats and the entry in the tables with sql queries to extract the rows count from them that satisfy the criterion 
Python language will help you to implement the questions easily. (A suggestion)
