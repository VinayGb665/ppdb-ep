Forward list in STL implements singly linked list. Introduced from C++11, forward list are useful than other containers in insertion, removal and moving operations (like sort) and allows time constant insertion and removal of elements.It differs from list by the fact that forward list keeps track of location of only next element while list keeps track to both next and previous elements.
remove() function is used to remove all the values from the forward list that correspond to the value given as parameter to the function
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. Shows error if the value passed doesn’t match the forward list type.
2. Shows no exception throw guarantee if the comparison between value and elements of the forward list feature doesn’t throw any exception.
