Given an integer array, find a maximum product of a triplet in array.
Examples: 
 
Approach 1 (Naive, O(n3) time, O(1) Space)
A simple solution is to check for every triplet using three nested loops. Below is its implementation –

Approach 2: O(n) Time, O(n) Space
Below is its C++ implementation –

Output : 
 
Approach 3: O(nlogn) Time, O(1) Space
Run on IDE
Output : 
 
Approach 4: O(n) Time, O(1) Space
Note – Step 1 and Step 2 can be done in single traversal of the array.

Exercise:
1. Print the triplet that has maximum product.
2. Find a minimum product of a triplet in array.
