Given an array of distinct elements and a number x, find if there is a pair with product equal to x. 
Examples : 
Naive approach ( O(n2) ) is to run two loops to consider all possible pairs.  For every pair, check if product is equal to  x or not.

Better Solution (O(n Log n) : We sort the given array. After sorting, we traverse the array and for every element arr[i], we do binary search for x/arr[i] in the subarry on right of arr[i], i.e., in subarray arr[i+1..n-1]
 
Efficient Solution ( O(n) ):  We can improve time complexity to O(n) using hashing.  Below are steps.
Below is the implementation of above idea.

In the next set, we will be discussing approach to print all pairs with product equal to 0.
