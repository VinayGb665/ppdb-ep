Following are the details of my interview with Goldman Sachs.
Round 1: Online Coding Round conducted on Hackerrank (1.5 hours)
The online test was of 100 points
It comprised 5 MCQs of 10 points each, with penalty of 3 point each for wrong answer.
There were 2 coding questions of 15 and 35 points respectively.
First Coding Question ‚Äì
Given a sentence, find the even length word of maximum length. In case of a tie, find the word which occurs earlier in the sentence. In case no such word exists, print ‚Äú00‚Äù.
Second Coding Question ‚Äì 
A greedy question almost similar to this question.
21 students were shortlisted after this round. 
Round 2: F2F Technical Round 1 (30 minutes)
11 students were shortlisted for the next round.
Round 3: F2F Technical Round 2 (1 hour 15 minutes)
Approach ‚Äì
Make a vector corresponding to each of the word present, which shall store its occurrences in the increasing order in the sentence.
Now, whenever a query is input, choose the vector corresponding to the word which has less number of elements.
Let the two vectors be A and B respectively ( Size of A <= Size of B )
Traverse the vector A, and for each of the element, find the value just smaller to it, and the value just larger than it in vector B.
This can easily be carried out using Binary Search. Find minimum difference over the entire traversal of vector A.
The interviewer carried out dry run on my solution, and checked it on several corner cases. He was satisfied with my solution.
Approach-
Identify the node which has 2 parents by making use of some visited array.
Now, find LCA of both the parents.
The value of LCA shall tell us if the corrupted node should lie on its left or on its right.
By this, we can remove the link of the wrong parent.
Round 4: HR Round (25 minutes)
Thanks Geeksforgeeks for being a perfect platform for practice. üôÇ
