Given two Binary Trees, write a function that returns true if two trees are mirror of each other, else false.  For example, the function should return true for following input trees.

This problem is different from the problem discussed here.
For two trees ‘a’ and ‘b’ to be mirror images, the following three conditions must be true:
Below is implementation of above idea.
