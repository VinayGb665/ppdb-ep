These functions return useful iterators to access vector elements in reverse order (from end to beginning)
Using vector::crend()
Itâ€™s a public member function that returns a const_reverse_iterator pointing to the element preceding the first element.
Return Value
Syntax:

Using vector::crbegin()
It returns a const_reverse_iterator pointing to the last element in the container (i.e., its reverse beginning)..

Applications
crend :
Returns a reverse iterator to the element following the last element of the reversed container. It corresponds to the element preceding the first element of the non-reversed container. This element acts as a placeholder, attempting to access it results in undefined behavior
crbegin :
Returns a reverse iterator to the first element of the reversed container. It corresponds to the last element of the non-reversed container.
Both are used in deque operations, concurrently accessing or modifying different elements is safe.
The copy construction or assignment of the returned iterator is also guaranteed to never throw exception.
