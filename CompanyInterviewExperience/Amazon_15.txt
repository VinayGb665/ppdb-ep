Given a string, find the first non-repeating character in it.  For example, if the input string is “GeeksforGeeks”, then output should be ‘f’ and if input string is “GeeksQuiz”, then output should be ‘G’.

We have discussed two solutions in Given a string, find its first non-repeating character .  In this post a further optimized solution (over method 2 of previous post) is discussed. The idea is to optimize space. Instead of using a pair to store count and index, we use single element that store index if element appears once, else stores a negative value.
