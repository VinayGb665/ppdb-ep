Given a positive integer n, check whether only the first and last bits are set in the binary representation of n. Print ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.
Examples:

Input: 9
Output: Yes
(9)10 = (1001)2, only the first and
last bits are set.
Input: 15
Output: No
(15)10 = (1111)2, except first and last
there are other bits also which are set.


We have already discussed a solution here.
In this post, a simpler solution is discussed.
