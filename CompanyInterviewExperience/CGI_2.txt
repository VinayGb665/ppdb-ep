10*9*8*7
11*12*13*14*15
2. Sorting in descending order according to their frequency.
Given array: 4 1 3 5 2 5 3 7 8 9 5 4

Part 4 was based on Business analytics.
Part 5 contained MCQs, match making on Operating system, Networking, DBMS etc.
92 students were selected for the technical round.
Round 2: It was a technical interview.
The interviewer has gone through my aptitude and coding answers of my first round. At first, he offered me water. After that he told me to tell about my family, education, hobbies. Then he told me to explain my projects. After the explanation he asked my favorite programming language and why it is favorite. He gave me some programming questions and puzzles.
There was 1 technical interview for me but for some students there were 2 technical rounds.
27 students were selected for Round 3.
Round 3: It was HR round. Before going for HR interview we made 2 selfie videos and one PPT on any topic related to technology (Machine Learning, Block chain, Augmented reality etc.)
HR asked me to tell about myself and asked my hobbies. Then he asked me ‘Why CGI?’, what do you CGI. If you get the job in CGI how would like to see yourself in next 5 years. How will you explain respect? He asked me about movies and asked me if I have any question about CGI .
