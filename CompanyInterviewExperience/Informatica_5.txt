Informatica conducted campus recruitment drive for 1 year internship for CSE and IT students. 345Â students were selected to appear for this drive (probably they have shortlisted candidates having CGPA>=8 points).
Round 1: Online MCQ Test (45 minutes)
This was an online MCQ test consisting of 30 questions to be solved, focused on subjects like Operating System, DBMS and Data Structure and Algorithms. There was no negative marking.
Tip: Go through the previous years GATE question papers; around 30-40% questions were from previous years GATE papers.
Results were declared in 10 minutes after the completion of this round. Out of 345, only 62 were selected for the next round.
Round 2: Coding Test (90 minutes)
This round was conducted to test our coding proficiency. Candidates were allowed to choose any language of their preference (C, C++, JAVA, C#, etc.). There were 4 questions (2 questions of 5 marks each and 2 questions of 10 marks each):
1. Given an array with repeated elements, find the sum of all distinct (non-repeating) elements.
Input: arr[]={2, 3, 1, 2, 6, 1}
Output: 9
Since 2 and 1 were repeated, they are not considered while calculating the sum.
2. Given an array with n elements and an integer k. Divide the array into subarrays, each of them containing k ekements.
For example:
Input: arr[]={1, 32, 5, 6, 9, 3} and k=2
The subarrays will have elements
{132}, {56}, {93}.
Now sort these subarrays as {56}, {93}, {132}. Merge these subarrays together and display them as the elements of original array in sorted order as
Final output: arr[]={5, 6, 9, 3, 1, 32}
3.Maximum non-contiguous subarray sum problem
4. Lexicographic rank of a string
A candidate who could solve a minimum of 2 questions was selected for the next round. Out of 62, only 26 could make it to the next round.
Tip: Go through the typical programming questions given in websites like geeksforgeeks, hackerearth, etc.
Round 3: Technical round
This was a Face-to-Face Interview. The technical round was a series of 3 rounds, one of which was conducted on the same day and the other two rounds were conducted on the following day (Day 1 interviews went till 9:30 P.M).
My interview went for around 1 hour. The interviewer asked me questions only on Data Structure that were totally conceptual.
1. Given a linked list of nodes having a random pointer in addition to the next pointer, where the random pointer points to any random node; write a program to make an exact replica of that linked list.
2. Write a program to reverse a linked list
3. Given a random node in a linked list, find two linked lists reversed from that node.
For example, if the linked list is A->B->C->D->E and the random node is C, then return C->B->A and E->D->C.
Note: No header pointer was given, only the random node was given.
4. Difference between an object and a pointer in JAVA.
5. What is data structure? Which is the best data structure for organizing and storing data?
There were some other questions like finding the shortest path and constraints on such algorithms.
Sadly, I got eliminated after this round.
Out of 26, only 13 could make it to the second technical round scheduled for the following day. The next day, only 8 could clear the second technical round, followed by third technical round.
Round 4: HR Interview
The 8 candidates had their HR Interview, after which only 5 were selected for their 1 year internship program.
