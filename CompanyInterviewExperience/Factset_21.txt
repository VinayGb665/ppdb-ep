I find GeeksforGeeks very helpful! It helped me prepare for my FactSet interview. Hereâ€™s my interview
experience for FactSet which came to my college for recruitment.
Round 1 (Written Coding) :
3 coding questions. (Pen and Paper mode Examination)
-print the element that is common in all rows of a matrix
 -Find median of two sorted arrays. O(logM + logN)
-Zig-zag traversal of binary tree.
Round 2(technical interview):
2 interviewers were there and the interview went on for about 60 minutes. Questions they asked were
mainly programming and puzzles and some of the operating system and database concepts.
-Given an array and a number k, find all pairs of numbers in array whose sum is least near to k.
-How to find intersecting point of two linked lists. (most efficient way).
-Design Database schema for supermarket (Reliance Fresh) taking care of all the factors about details of
discounts and offers to customers.
-puzzle as follows:
__ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
Fill numbers in the above blank from 0-9 such that number X coming over any number Y means Y should
be in X blanks. For eg: if 2 comes over 0 means 0 should be present in 2 blanks.
Round 3 (technical interview + HR):
2 interviewers and 60 minute duration. It was mixture of both technical and HR round.
-Tell me about youself?
-Given a matrix of characters and a string, find the first index of string in matrix. String can be horizontally,vertically, diagonally present in any direction.
-Questions on hashing and combining it with networks. How to implement it and its uses in various
fields.
-Brief discussion of project done in internship and questions over it.
