In the previous post on trie we have described how to insert and search a node in trie. Here is an algorithm how to delete a node from trie.
During delete operation we delete the key in bottom up manner using recursion. The following are possible conditions when deleting key from trie,
The highlighted code presents algorithm to implement above conditions. (One may be in dilemma how a pointer passed to delete helper is reflecting changes from deleteHelper to deleteKey. Note that we are holding trie as an ADT in trie_t node, which is passed by reference or pointer).
