How to implement ternary operator in C++ without using conditional statements.
In the following condition : a ? b : c
If a is true, b will be executed.
Otherwise, c will be executed.
We can assume a, b and c as values.
We can code the equation as :
Result = (!!a)*b + (!a)*c
In above equation, is a is true, result will be b.
Otherwise, result will be c.
