Wilson’s theorem states that a natural number p > 1 is a prime number if and only if 
Examples:
How does it work?
1) We can quickly check result for p = 2 or p = 3.
2) For p > 3:  If p is composite, then its positive divisors are among the integers 1, 2, 3, 4, … , p-1 and it is clear that gcd((p-1)!,p) > 1, so we can not have (p-1)! = -1 (mod p). 
3) Now let us see how it is exactly -1 when p is a prime.  If p is a prime, then all numbers in [1, p-1] are relatively prime to p. And for every number x in range [2, p-2], there must exist a pair y such that (x*y)%p = 1.  So 
How can it be useful?
Consider the problem of computing factorial under modulo of a prime number which is close to input number, i.e., we want to find value of “n! % p” such that n < p, p is a prime and n is close to p.   For example (25! % 29).  From Wilson's theorem, we know that 28! is -1.   So we basically need to find  [ (-1) * inverse(28, 29) * inverse(27, 29) * inverse(26) ] % 29.   The inverse function inverse(x, p) returns inverse of x under modulo p (See this for details).
