I have recently faced an interview with Deloitte US, I would like to share the experience for fellow geeks.
The entire process consist of 6 rounds(1 Written, 2 Technical, 1 English, 1 Director, 1 HR).
The written test was outsourced to a third party(cocubes) , consisting of 30 MCQs to be solved in 30 mins.
These are all technical questions with various kind of difficulty level. Few programs in predict the output questions has compilation failures, thus one need to be extra careful before answering the questions.
Next technical round consist of F2F interviews, I was asked the following questions:
3rd Technical Round was another F2F round mainly coding related.
4th round was a English Test from yet another outsourced vendor(https://www.versanttest.com/). Please check this site they have sample questions.
5th round was a Directorial round where senior manager kind of a person will give you insights of different aspects of projects and services. If shifts are there, why do you want to leave your present organization, why do you want to join Deloitte etc.
6th round was Salary negotiation round.
