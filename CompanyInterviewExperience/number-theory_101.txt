Given an odd number, we need to express it as the sum of at most three prime numbers.  
Examples :

Approach : Here, we use Goldbach’s conjecture to solve this problem. It says that any even integer can be expressed as sum of two prime numbers.
We have three cases here:
1) When N is a prime number, print the number.
2) When (N-2) is a prime number, print 2 and N-2.
3) Express N as 3 + (N-3). Obviously, N-3 will be an even number (subtraction of an odd from another odd results in even). So, according to Goldbach’s conjecture, it can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. So, print 3 and other two prime numbers.
