Given array of sorted integer, search key and search preferences find array position. A search preferences can be:
1) EQUAL – search only for equal key or -1 if not found. It’s a regular binary search.
2) EQUAL_OR_SMALLER – search only for equal key or the closest smaller. -1 if not found.
3) EQUAL_OR_BIGGER – search only for equal key or the closest bigger. -1 if not found.
Examples:
In regular binary search algorithm evaluation and division perform as far as subarray size is bigger than 0.
In our case if we want to keep single function we need to perform final evaluation in subarray of size=2. Only in subarray size==2 is possible to check both EQUAL_OR_SMALLER and EQUAL_OR_BIGGER conditions.  
In below code, SC stands for Search Criteria.
