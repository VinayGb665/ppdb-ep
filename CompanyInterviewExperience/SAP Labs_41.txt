Given a string, remove all spaces from the string and return it. 
 
Expected time complexity is O(n) and only one traversal of string.


Below is a Simple Solution 
Time complexity of above solution is O(n2).
A Better Solution can solve it in O(n) time. The idea is to keep track of count of non-space character seen so far.  
Below are C++ and Python implementation of above algorithm.

Time complexity of above solution is O(n) and it does only one traversal of string.
Another solution suggested by Divyam Madaan is to use predefined functions. Here is the implementation:
