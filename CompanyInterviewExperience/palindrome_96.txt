Given a string, write a c function to check if it is palindrome or not. 
A string is said to be palindrome if reverse of the string is same as string.  For example, “abba” is palindrome, but “abbc” is not palindrome.

Algorithm:
isPalindrome(str)
1) Find length of str. Let length be n.
2) Initialize low and high indexes as 0 and n-1 respectively.
3) Do following while low index ‘l’ is smaller than high index ‘h’.
…..a) If str[l] is not same as str[h], then return false.
…..b) Increment l and decrement h, i.e., do l++ and h–.
4) If we reach here, it means we didn’t find a mis
Following is C implementation to check if a given string is palindrome or not.

Output: 
Recursive function to check if a string is palindrome
