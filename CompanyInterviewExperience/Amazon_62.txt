 Online Round 
 It consists of 20 mcqs and two coding questions where MCQS got the negative marking , One for the correct answer and -0.25 for each wrong answer. 
1.Given a string. Find all the palindromic partitions of the string. (Number of way the string can be partitioned so that all the partitions are palindrome)( Case – Insensitive )
Examples:
Link for the following question
2. You are given with a large paragraph and N words.You have to find a min length subparagraph of the paragraph which contain all those N words in any order.(Case Insensitive)
Only 33 students got selected for the next round
Round 2( Technical Interview )
First the Interviewer introduced himself and then asked me to introduce yourself
He gave me only one question 
Given a positive number and you have to find all the no. that holds the property of all the digits with absolute difference equal to 1 to its adjacent digit below that given number.
I gave a brute force solution first and then he asked me to optimize it. We had a long discussion then he asked me to code the solution.
Only 6 students got selected for the next round.
Round 3( Technical Interview )
The interviewer started with the most common questions “Tell me about yourself” , in which I explained my projects , my achievements and my strengths.
The round started with long discussions on following Questions of Operating Systems.
1. What is deadlock? and situation where you have faced deadlock.
2. Scheduling Algorithms.
3. Code LRU Cache
4. Banker’s Algorithm.
5. Paging , Segmentation etc.
6. How compiler compiles the interlinked libraries.( Using Topological Sort ) and asked me to code for the same.
One Coding was asked in last
Trapping Rain Water
In Last interviewer winded up the interview with “Any questions for me?”
Verdict : Selected
Only 3 students were offered internship
