Given an undirected graph, task is to find the minimum number of weakly connected nodes after converting this graph into directed one.
Weakly Connected Nodes : Nodes which are having 0 indegree(number of incoming edges).
Prerequisite : BFS traversal
Examples :
Explanation :

Approach :  We find a node which helps in traversing maximum nodes in a single walk. To cover all possible paths,  DFS graph traversal technique is used for this.
Do the above steps to traverse the graph. Now, iterate through graph again and check which nodes are having 0 indegree.
