I gave the Morgan Stanley aptitude test, here’s my experience.
So here’s how it went.
The test was for 200 marks 90 min duration without any breaks and you can attempt any sections in any order. The test was conducted on hackerrank.com.
50 marks algorithms, data structures and logical reasoning mcqs. There were 20 mcqs.
The logical reasoning mcqs were based on proving if a statement is correct and deriving relations.
The data structure mcqs consisted of graphs and trees. Questions were like given n leaves and m internal nodes what is the height of the tree, one on full binary tree height, BFS output for a given graph.
In Algorithms, we were mostly asked about time complexity .
Now for the coding section there were two questions.
1. Given a pseudo random string of length 26 with characters from a to z such that the indices are represented as 00, 01, … 26. And another string E which contains an encoded string based on the above indices like 000723… Derive the decoded string from the two. The constraint on E is that it could range till 10^8.
2. I don’t recall the exact question but here’s how it goes. Given a input such as
