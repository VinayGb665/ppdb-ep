Given a set of strings, find the longest common prefix.
Previous Approaches –  Word by Word Matching ,  Character by Character Matching,  Divide and Conquer 
In this article, an approach using Binary Search is discussed.
Steps:
Algorithm Illustration considering strings as – “geeksforgeeks”, “geeks”, “geek”, “geezer”

Output :
Time Complexity : 
The recurrence relation is
where
So we can say that the time complexity is O(NM log M)
Auxiliary Space: To store the longest prefix string we are allocating space which is O(N) where, N = length of the largest string among all the strings
