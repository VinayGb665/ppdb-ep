Fibonomial Coefficient
In mathematics, the Fibonomial coefficients or Fibonacci-binomial coefficients are defined as

where n and k are non-negative integers, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, Fj is the j-th Fibonacci number and n!F is the nth Fibonorial, where 0!F, being the empty product, evaluates to 1.
The Fibonomial coefficients are all integers. Some special values are:





Fibonomial triangle
The Fibonomial coefficients are similar to binomial coefficients and can be displayed in a triangle similar to Pascal’s triangle. The first eight rows are shown below.
