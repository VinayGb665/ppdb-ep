Given a decimal number N. The task is to find 10’s complement of the number N.
Example:
10’s complement of a decimal number can be found by adding 1 to the 9’s complement of that decimal number. It is just like 2s compliment in binary number representation.
Mathematically, 

10’s complement = 9’s complement + 1

For example, let us take a decimal number 456, 9’s complement of this number will be 999-456 which will be 543. Now 10s compliment will be 543+1=544.
Therefore, 

10’s complement = 10len – num
Below is the program to find 10’s complement of a given number:
