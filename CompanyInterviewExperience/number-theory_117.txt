Given a positive number N. We need to find number(s) such that sum of digits of those numbers to themselves is equal to N. If no such number is possible print -1. Here N 
Examples:

Method 1 : (Naive Approach) We have already discussed the approach here. The approach might not work for N as large as .
Method 2 : (Efficient)It is a fact that for a number X < = 1000000000, the sum of digits never exceeds 100. Using this piece of information, we can iterate over all possibilities in the range 0 to 100 on both the sides of the number and check if the number X is eqaul to N - sum of digits of X. All the possibilities will be covered in this range.

The maximum complexity of this approach can be  where len is the number of digits in the number max(len) = 9. Thus the complexity can almost be said to be
