 
Lenskart bangalore office is a small one with limited intake and space too.
I was called for F2F discussion for the post of Software developer through a consultancy.
Round 1: Paper Pen Based Written Test
Java, Multithreading, Collections MCQ’s felt bit tricky.
Could have cleared with minimum practice.
Two programming problems with choice for each one
1.Array based probem to find pair of numbers whose product is given k value
OR
Find zero sum subarray if exists
2. Tree based problem – count number of leave in given binary tree
Followed by F2F Discussion.
All the Best
