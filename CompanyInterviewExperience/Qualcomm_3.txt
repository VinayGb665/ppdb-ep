Qualcomm process contains 4 or 5 rounds – 
Round – I
Note – Questions are moderate, but time is very less. Be quick in this section!
Note – Programming mcqs are easy, but technical mcqs are not so easy. Questions are based on fundamentals of programming(c/c++). Focus on basics of C/C++, Operating system, COA, DS and algorithms. Again Be quick in this section also.
Round – II
This round was very interesting. He asked me to Introduce Myself !
After that he jumped on the technical section directly.
Round – III
This round was very boring, because Interviewer was not giving any outputs whether I was correct or not. He was asking questions in a sequence.
I answered each and every question. I was very nervous after this round as the interviewer was not responding anything, he was asking questions only. Then i waited for Hr round for 2-3 hours.
Round – IV
HR round, Again he asked the same repeated and boring questions. Please do not prepare for these questions! According to the situation, predict the answer, what the HR wants.
Finally result came at 11:00pm and I was in the selected list of students.
