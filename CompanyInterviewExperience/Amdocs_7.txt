Given two sorted arrays, we need to merge them in O((n+m)*log(n+m)) time with O(1) extra space into a sorted array, when n is the size of the first array, and m is the size of the second array.
Example:
We have discussed a quadratic time solution in below post.
Merge two sorted arrays with O(1) extra space
In this post a better solution is discussed. 
The idea: we start comparing elements that are far from each other rather than adjacent.
For every pass, we calculate the gap and compare the elements towards the right of the gap. Every pass, the gap reduces to the ceiling value of dividing by 2.
