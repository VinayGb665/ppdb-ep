Given a natural number n, print all distinct divisors of it.
Examples: 
We strongly recommend to refer below article as a prerequisite.
Find all divisors of a natural number | Set 1
In the above  post, we had found a way to find all the divisors in O(sqrt(n)) .
However there is still a minor problem in the solution, can you guess?
Yes!  the output is not in a sorted fashion which we had got using brute-force technique.
How to print the output in sorted order?
If we observe the output which we had got, we can analyze that the divisors are printed in a zig-zag fashion (small, large pairs). Hence if we store half of them then we can print then in a sorted order. 
Below is a implementation for the same:
