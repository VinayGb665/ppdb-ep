Given a 2D grid of characters and a word, find all occurrences of given word in  grid.  A word can be matched in all 8 directions at any point. Word is said be found in a direction if all characters match in this direction (not in zig-zag form).
The 8 directions are, Horizontally Left, Horizontally Right, Vertically Up and 4 Diagonal directions.
Example:
Below diagram shows a bigger grid and presence of different words in it.

The idea used here is simple, we check every cell. If cell has first character, then we one by one try all 8 directions from that cell for a match.  Implementation is interesting though.  We use two arrays x[] and y[] to find next move in all 8 directions.
Below is C++ implementation of the same.

Output: 
Exercise: The above solution only print locations of word.  Extend it to print the direction where word is present.
See this for solution of exercise.
