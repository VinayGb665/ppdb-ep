I had an interview with GS at their Bengaluru office. I have 4 years of experience in full stack development using Java. I had got a call from a consultant.
Round 1

Round 2

Was told to leave for the day. Advice: Try not bringing up design patterns unless asked to do so or u have experience in solving problems with design patterns. Listen to the interviewer and be alert. They provide hints. In round 1 too, I had done a mistake in the rotated array question. He gave a test case where my code would fail. I corrected the pitfall. Take enough sleep before the day of interview.
