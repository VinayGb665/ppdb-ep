For any given number n, print  Hollow and solid Squares and Rhombus made with stars(*).
Examples:
1. Solid Rhombus : Making Solid Rhombus is a bit similar to making solid square rather than the concept that for each ith row we have n-i blank spaces before stars as:
– – – ****
– – ****
– ****
****
2. Hollow Rhombus :  Formation of Hollow Rhombus uses the idea behind formation of hollow square and solid rhombus. A hollow square with n-i blank spaces before stars in each ith rows result in formation of hollow rhombus.
