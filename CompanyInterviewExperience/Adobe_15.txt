Given, an array of size n. Find an element which divides the array in two sub-arrays with equal sum.
Examples:
Method 1 (Simple)
Consider every element starting from second element. Compute sum of elements on its left and sum of elements on its right. If these two sums are same, return the element.
Method 2 (Using Prefix and Suffx Arrays :

Method 3 (Space efficient)
We calculate the sum of the whole array except the first element in right_sum, considering it to be the partitioning element. Now, we traverse the array from left to right, subtracting an element from right_sum and adding an element to left_sum. The point where right_sum equals left_sum, we get the partition.
