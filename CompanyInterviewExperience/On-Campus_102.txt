Round 1:
Round 1 was the MCQ + Coding + Essay Writing.
In the MCQâ€™s, there were 60 questions. These questions were very tricky and tough. I must say that you must prepare and should be thorough with conceptual questions from Data Structure, Software Engineering, Database Management System, Operating System and Networking.
There was only 2 MCQ for aptitude (One was of Men-work-hour question), 3-4 MCQ of English ( Paragraphs and its inference were given, needed to pick the correct one)Â  Then the rest were from the subjects mentioned above. Some MCQâ€™s were theoretical and some of them were also True and False. So you should be clear with the definition and function of each topic.

Then there was Essay writing. Some of the topics were:

Round 2:
Some students were selected for direct interview, but their package was low. Others were selected for next round, which was of Advance Coding Test. Here, one competitive question was asked and a good compiler was given. We could write the code in Python, C, Java, and one more which I dont remember now.
The question was of shortest path from starting point to a given point in a N*N matrix.
I hope you got all my points and came to know about Persistent System Tests.
All the best ðŸ™‚ Prepare well .
