F-2-F round 3
F-2-F round 4
Longest oneâ€¦.this interview went on for 1 hour and 30 minutes but was interesting one(interviewer looked lyk a frustrated guyâ€¦some tyms I felt that he is going to punch me ðŸ˜› :P)
Finally this interview also went well he was happy with my performance
After 2-3 days I got mail from the HR that I m rejected LL reason was bar raiser â€¦ 1 advise to all donâ€™t take BR round lightly it does not matter how well u performed in other round if u didnâ€™t do well in BR round then there is no way u can make it. An average round tech interview is fine but average BR round means rejected.
