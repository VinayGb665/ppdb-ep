Given two integer N ans K, the task is to find sum of modulo K of first N natural numbers i.e 1%K + 2%K + ….. + N%K.
Examples :

Method 1:
Iterate a varible i from 1 to N, evaluate and add i%K.

Time Complexity : O(N).
Method 2 :
Two cases arise in this method.
Case 1: When N < K, for each number i, N >= i >= 1, will give i as result when operate with modulo K. So, required sum will be sum of first N natural number, N*(N+1)/2.
Case 2: When N >= K, then integers from 1 to K in natural number sequence will produce, 1, 2, 3, ….., K – 1, 0 as result when operate with modulo K. Similarly, from K + 1 to 2K, it will produce same result. So, the idea is to count how many number of times this sequence appears and multiply it with sum of first K – 1 natural numbers.
