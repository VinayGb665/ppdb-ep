Recently salesforce visited our campus and took the following rounds for the final selection.
Round 1:
Written aptitude round containing basic questions on C and C++ programming.The questions were easy.
Around 10 students were selected for second round.
Round 2(Online coding at ideone.com:
1.Write  a program to find the number of valid parenthesis in a given expression.
For eg:
((()))) contains 3 valid parenthesis and hj()(i()) contain 2 valid parenthesis.
I solved it using stack.
2.Write a program to print the output solution for the rat so that he can reach his hole assuming that there is  a unique path possible.(1 represents that path is possible and 0 means that path is not possible).
input :
Output:
It was a simple question and solved it using two nested for loops.
Around 6 students were selected after this round.
Round 3(Technical):
He asked me two tough questions:
1.You are a given an integer .You have to print all the possible valid parenthesis for this integer.
For eg for n=2,we have o/p= ()() ,(()),etc
I solved it using this approach.I first print all the possible permutations for a string possible using that integer and then finally check if it is a valid parenthesis,then print it.
2.FInd the angle between hour and minute hand when time is 3:15 assuming an analog clock.
I was not selected after this round but i want to thanks geeksforgeeks for helping me in this interview.
