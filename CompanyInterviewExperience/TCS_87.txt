TCS arrived my college this year on Nov 2014. I wanted to share  my experience with all of u , so here it is..
1. Online Aptitude test.
2. Technical Interview.
3. MR Interview.
4. HR Interview.
Tips to prepare:
Quantitative Aptitude comprise of 30 questions with negative marking. Starred questions will be of higher marks. The set I got had 10-12 easy questions, 4-5 tough questions, and rest medium level. Try to do atleast 18 out of them to clear the round. (If there is not much time left as compared to the number of questions you may take help of yur neighbor as many people in my slot did, though its better to do it on your own as you can’t trust others.)
Questions comprised of following areas:-
Time and Work (Questions related to calculation of Wages for work),
Number System,
Functions and Series,
Geometry,
Probability(Total Probability and Bayer’s),
Time, Speed and Distance,
Ages,
Permutations and Combinations.
We also had a PPT in after this round in which TCS declared results of 1st round and told about the company, objectives, statistics, mission, values, etc.
