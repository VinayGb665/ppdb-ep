The test based on HirePro Examination. They had outsourced the first round to HirePro and had asked them for results on the basis of which students were called for the next rounds. The test was difficult especially Quants and Computer Science section, I had gotten advice from my seniors to study from PrepInsta. Some questions were repeated from there thus, I was able to solve the Question Paper in time but still, it was lengthy and most of us failed to solve all the questions in time correctly.
Round 1: 
In written exam with three section,
Time – 25 min
Number of Questions – 20 Questions
Round 2: Technical interview
Round 3 / HR:
Most of the questions in HR round were basic and thus, I don’t think you need anything special just speak confident and good English.
