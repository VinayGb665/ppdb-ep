Given a positive integer, check if the number is prime or not.  A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  Examples of first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5,

Examples :
 School Method 
A simple solution is to iterate through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and for every number check if it divides n.  If we find any number that divides, we return false. 
Below is the implementation of this method.
