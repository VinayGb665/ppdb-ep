Sequence containers
Sequence containers implement data structures which can be accessed sequentially.
Associative containers
Associative containers implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
Unordered associative containers
Unordered associative containers implement unsorted (hashed) data structures that can be quickly searched (O(1) amortized, O(n) worst-case complexity).
Container adaptors
Container adaptors provide a different interface for sequential containers.
