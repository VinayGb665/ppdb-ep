This problem is know as Clock angle problem where we need to find angle between hands of an analog clock at a given time.
Examples: 
The idea is to take 12:00 (h = 12, m = 0) as a reference. Following are detailed steps.
1) Calculate the angle made by hour hand with respect to 12:00 in h hours and m minutes.
2) Calculate the angle made by minute hand with respect to 12:00 in h hours and m minutes.
3) The difference between two angles is the angle between two hands.
How to calculate the two angles with respect to 12:00? 
The minute hand moves 360 degree in 60 minute(or 6 degree in one minute) and hour hand moves 360 degree in 12 hours(or 0.5 degree in 1 minute).  In h hours and m minutes, the minute hand would move (h*60 +  m)*6 and hour hand would move (h*60 + m)*0.5.
