Priority queues are a type of container adaptors, specifically designed such that the first element of the queue is the greatest of all elements in the queue.
empty() function is used to check if the priority queue container is empty or not.
Syntax :
Examples:
Errors and Exceptions
1. Shows error if a parameter is passed
2. Shows no exception throw guarantee.
Run on IDE
Output:
Application : Given a priority queue of integers, find the sum of the all the integers.
Algorithm
1. Check if the priority queue is empty, if not add the top element to a variable initialised as 0, and pop the top element.
2. Repeat this step until the priority queue is empty.
3. Print the final value of the variable.
Run on IDE
Output:
size() function is used to return the size of the priority queue container or the number of elements in the container.

Algorithm
1. Check if the size of the priority queue is 0, if not add the top element to a variable initialised as 0, and pop the top element.
2. Repeat this step until the sizeof the priority queue becomes 0.
3. Print the final value of the variable.
