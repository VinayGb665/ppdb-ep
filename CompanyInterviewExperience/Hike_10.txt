Profile: Automation Testing/Manual Testing
Process: Written Test (90 Minutes) + 2 Technical Interviews.
Round 1 (Written Test)
It consists of 50 questions (including 2 programming questions, mandatory for Automation Testing). For Manual Testing, test case were to be written for an Instant Messaging app like hike/whatsapp.
Section 1- General Aptitude/Logical
Section 2- Software Knowledge (Questions like latest version of iOS, Windows, Android. Operating Systems etc)
Section 3- Database and Linux
Section 4- Computer Programming (Output questions of java/c/c++, generic questions related to programming)
Coding Question 1: 
Given a string of parentheses, write a program to find whether its valid or not.
Examples-
input: {{{}}}
output: Valid
input: }{}{}{}}
output: Invalid
Coding Question 2: 
Given ‘m’ number of small bricks (each x inches long) and ‘n’ big bricks (each y inches long), we want to create row which is z inches long using combination of small and big bricks. Write a program to verify whether it is possible to create such row of bricks or not.
Note: Solution Mx + Ny = z is not recommended.
 Examples-
input: We have 4(m) small bricks each 3 inches(x) long and 3(n) big bricks each 4 inches(y) long. We need to create row which is 14(z) inches long.
output: Yes
input: We have 2(m) small bricks each 2 inches(x) long and 2(n) big bricks each 5 inches(y) long. We need to create row which is 6(z) inches long.
output: No (no combination of bricks will make wall which is 6 inches long).
Interview:

Convert a binary tree into its mirror.
Reversing a linked list.
Database Queries etc. were asked.
