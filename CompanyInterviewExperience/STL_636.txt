Given an array of positive and negative numbers, find if there is a subarray (of size at-least one) with 0 sum.
Examples :
A simple solution is to consider all subarrays one by one and check the sum of every subarray. We can run two loops: the outer loop picks a starting point i and the inner loop tries all subarrays starting from i (See this for implementation). Time complexity of this method is O(n2).
We can also use hashing.  The idea is to iterate through the array and for every element arr[i], calculate sum of elements form 0 to i (this can simply be done as sum += arr[i]).  If the current sum has been seen before, then there is a zero sum array.   Hashing is used to store the sum values, so that we can quickly store sum and find out whether the current sum is seen before or not.
Example :
Following is implementation of the above approach.

Time Complexity of this solution can be considered as O(n) under the assumption that we have good hashing function that allows insertion and retrieval operations in O(1) time.
Exercise:
Extend the above program to print starting and ending indexes of all subarrays with 0 sum.
