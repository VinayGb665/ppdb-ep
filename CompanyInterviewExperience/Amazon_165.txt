Given a string of lowercase alphabets and a number k, the task is to print the minimum value of the string after removal of ‘k’ characters.  The value of a string is defined as the sum of squares of the count of each distinct character. For example consider the string “saideep”, here frequencies of characters are s-1, a-1, i-1, e-2, d-1, p-1 and value of the string is 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2 + 1^1 + 2^2 = 9.

One clear observation is that we need to remove character with highest frequency.  One trick is the character ma
A Simple solution is to use sorting technique through all current highest frequency reduce up to k times. For After every reduce again sort frequency array. 
A Better Solution used to Priority Queue which has to the highest element on top.
Below is the implementation of the above idea.
