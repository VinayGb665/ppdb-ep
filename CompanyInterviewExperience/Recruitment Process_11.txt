Practice Placement Tracks
Data Structures and Algorithms is a topic which can be mastered only by practice. Only theoretical knowledge of this subject is not sufficient for cracking interviews. We have prepared a complete track of previously asked interview questions and newly framed questions based on various important DS and Algo concepts (See here: practice.geeksforgeeks.org). This track will also have most frequently asked questions in the interviews of several companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Flipkart etc.
Some important links for practising DS/Algo:
Apart from problems on DS/Algo we also have MCQ questions on Aptitude, Programming languages(C, C++, Java etc.), basics of Data Structures and other CS subjects.
We also have prepared theoretical articles on various CS subjects that are frequently asked in interviews:
Mock Placement Test
Practicing repeatedly on our practice tracks as suggested above will obviously make you familiar with the topics but to help you utilize the knowledge you have gained we have prepared a Mock Placement Tests series for both Mass Recruiters and Tech Giants which will be conducted weekly.
