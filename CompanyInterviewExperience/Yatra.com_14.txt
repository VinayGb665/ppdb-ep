Recently I had appeared for Yatra Interview. I would like to share my experience.
1st Round: (Technical Round)
—————————-
1. Tell me about yourself and your current company work.
2. Find whether two strings are anagrams of each other or not.What would happen if strings are very large.
3. Level Order traversal of a binary tree.
4. Given an unsorted array: Print all pairs having sum equal to given sum. After solving this, question was modified  NOT to print duplicate pairs.
2nd Round: (Technical Round)
—————————-
1. Tell me about yourself and your current company work.
2. Find whether a binary tree is BST or NOT.
3. Design a stack with findMax() (getting maximum element from stack) in O(1).
4. Given a binary tree, find whether all leaves are at same level or not.
5. Check whether given linked list is palindrome or not.Write optimized code handling all edge cases.
3rd Round: (HR Round)
———————
1. Normal HR Questions.
2. Difference between HashMap & LinkedHashMap.
After few days, I got the offer :D. Thanks to GeeksForGeeks for providing solutions in a very simple manner which helped me a lot in the preparation. To crack Yatra interview, Data Structures and Algorithms concepts should be clear. Knowing Java/C++ is a plus point.
