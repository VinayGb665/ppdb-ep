Given an array of n elements, where each element is at most k away from its target position, devise an algorithm that sorts in O(n log k) time.  For example, let us consider k is 2, an element at index 7 in the sorted array, can be at indexes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 in the given array.  It may be assumed that k < n.
A simple solution is to sort the array using any standard sorting algorithm. The time complexity of this solution is O(n Log n)
A better solution is to use priority queue (or heap data structure).  
We have discussed a simple implementation in Sort a nearly sorted (or K sorted) array.  In this post, an STL based implementation is done.

Time Complexity : O(n Log k)
Auxiliary Space : O(k)
