Given an even number (greater than 2 ), print two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number. There may be several combinations possible. Print only first such pair. 
An interesting point is, a solution always exist according to Goldbachâ€™s conjecture.
Examples :

The idea is to find all the primes less than or equal to the given number N using Sieve of Eratosthenes. Once we have an array that tells all primes, we can traverse through this array to find pair with given sum.
