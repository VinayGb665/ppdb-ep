Round 1:
This was an online round which was held on Samsung’s own platform. The test duration was of 3 hours and one question was there. The constrains were like, you can do only 5 submissions, though you can compile and run the code any number of times. You can’t use any other library apart from the <stdio.h>/<iostream>. Your code must pass all the 10 test cases. The question was to find if the graph is bipartite or not. If yes, then print those vertices having color assigned as 1, given that the first source is of color 1.
Around 200 students appeared for this round, 44 were selected for the further rounds.
Round 2: 
Next round was a F2F round. My interviewer was a good person and was more inclined towards logic and understanding of the problem. He went through my resume. I had done projects and internship in Computer vision and Machine Learning. He asked me the following questions:-
Next few questions were related to machine learning and computer vision:
Other questions asked from my friends were like, non-recursive mutex, paging, mesh technology, OSI models.
Round 3:
This round was taken by someone else. Initially, He asked me where I belong to and how to reach there. Then he asked me following questions:
Round 4: 
This was a kind of  HR round, He just asked us basic questions like about the place we belong from, what is AI, what is Machine Learning in a layman term.
