Given a positive integer n. The task is to find count of digits of number which evenly divides the number n.
Examples:

The idea is to find each digit of the number n by modulus 10 and then check whether it divides n or not. Accordingly, increment the counter. Notice that the digit can be 0, so take care of that case.
