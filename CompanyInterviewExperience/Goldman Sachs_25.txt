Goldman Sachs Recently visited our campus ( Cummins College Pune ). The Eligibility Crieteria was cgpa > 6 and no live backlog . All the branches were allowed . Around 400+ people were there for aptitude .
 
Round 1:
First round was Aptitude Test . Aptitude test was held  on Hackerrank . It was 60 min test  consisting of 8 MCQ and 1 Code.
There was negative Marking . MCQ were based on Data Structures, Time Complexity.
I dont remember all MCQ, but few were as follows.
1.  Preorder and Inorder traversal of tree were given we have to find postorder traversal.
2. 
Find the time complexity of above code.
 
Coding Question
Old Library Catalog and New Library Catalog was Given .
for eg .   I/P
Old Catalog  = { 10, 11, 14, 15, 16}
New Catalog =   { 10, 12 , 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 16 }
O/P    =  { 0, -1, 1, 1, 3 }
 
we have to find the position of books are changed or not.
if the postion is same as old catalog the  add 0 for that book return arr.
if the book is not there in new catalog then  add -1 for that book in return arr
if the position is changed the add the shift in the return arr.
It is easy to do with HASHMAP .
After Aptitude 24  were Shortlisted.
Round 2 :
