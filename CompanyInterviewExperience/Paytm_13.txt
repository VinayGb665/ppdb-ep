You are given a sorted array of N integers from 1 to N with one number missing find the missing number Expected time complexity O(logn)
Examples:
A simple solution is to linearly traverse the given array. Find the point where current element is not one more than previous.
An efficient solution is to use binary search. We use the index to search for the missing element and modified binary search. If element at mid != index+1 and this is first missing element then mid  + 1 is the missing element. Else if this is not first missing element but ar[mid] != mid+1 search in left half. Else search in right half and if left>right then no element is missing.
