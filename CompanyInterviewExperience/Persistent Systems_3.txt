Round 1 : Online test 
Round 2 : Technical Interview 1
Round 3 : Technical Interview 2
Then I was moved to TR 2 where I was asked a coding questions and project related questions. After that he again asked me 3 puzzles.The puzzles are really of great quality so my suggestion is keep solving puzzles daily. Then he said if I had any question for him.I asked him it was my first interview how did you feel interviewing me. He told me two things first was “you are technically sound and you would fit into the kind of role we are offering” second “there are certain areas in which you need to do homework”. Then I was asked to wait out.
HR Round
Within 5 mins I was asked to move to the HR panel. In HR panel she asked me behavioral questions and also about the projects I had done and the problems that came in my path during the project implementation and how I over-comed. During HR I was given the offer letter and I came out. That’s it.  Personal suggestion they are looking for someone with sound TECHNICAL knowledge apart from good analytical skills and problem solving capabilities.All the best.
