In number theory, a Leyland number is a number of the form xy + yx, where x and y are integers greater than 1 and 1 <y <= x.
Given a positive integer N. The task is to print first N Leyland number in ascending order. The first few Leyland numbers are 8, 17, 32, 54, 57, 100, â€¦
Examples:

The idea to run two loop, one for x and other for y. The outer loop start with 2 to n and for each iteration of outer loop, run inner loop start from 2 t x. And store xy + yx in an array. After calculating all the value sort them and print first n numbers.
Below is the implementation of this approach:
