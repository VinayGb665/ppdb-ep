Given three numbers sum S, prime P and N, find all N prime numbers after prime P such that their sum is equal to S.
Examples :

Approach : The approach used is to produce all the primes less than S and greater than P. And then backtracking to find if such N primes exist whose sum equals S.
For example, S = 10, N = 2, P = 2
