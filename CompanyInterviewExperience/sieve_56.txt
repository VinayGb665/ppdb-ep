Given an array of natural numbers count the sum of its proper divisors for every element in array.

A naive solution to this problem has been discussed in below post.
Sum of all proper divisors of a natural number
We can do this more efficiently by making use of sieve of Eratosthenes.
The idea is based on prime factorization of a number. By using sieve we can store all the prime factors of a number and their powers.
Below is implementation based on above formula.
