Given a Binary Tree, print all nodes that don’t have a sibling (a sibling is a node that has same parent. In a Binary Tree, there can be at most one sibling).   Root should not be printed as root cannot have a sibling.
For example, the output should be “4 5 6” for the following tree.

This is a typical tree traversal question.  We start from root and check if the node has one child, if yes then print the only child of that node.  If node has both children, then recur for both the children.

Time Complexity of above code is O(n) as the code does a simple tree traversal.
