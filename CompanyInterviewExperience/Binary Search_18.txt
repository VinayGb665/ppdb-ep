Given an array of distinct integers, print all the pairs having a positive value and negative value of a number that exists in the array.
Note: Order of the pairs doesnâ€™t matter.
Examples:
A naive approach is to run two loops i.e. Consider each element of the array using the outer loop and search for its corresponding positive/negative value in the array using an inner loop. Similarly, find all the pairs. Time Complexity of this approach will be O( n2).
A better approach is to use sorting i.e. first sort the array and then for each negative element, do a binary search to find its counterpart (+ve number). If found, print that pair. If the current element is positive then break that loop as after that there will be all the positive numbers.
