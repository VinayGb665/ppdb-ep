This approach is based on Wilsonâ€™s theorem and using the fact that factorial computation can be done easily using DP 
Wilson theorem says if a number k is prime then ((k-1)! + 1) % k must be 0.
Below is Python implementation of the approach. Note that the solution works in Python because Python supports large integers by default therefore factorial of large numbers can be computed.
