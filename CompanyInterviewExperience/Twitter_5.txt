This article covers the sentiment analysis of any topic by parsing the tweets fetched from Twitter using Python.

What is sentiment analysis?
Sentiment Analysis is the process of ‘computationally’ determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. It’s also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.
Why sentiment analysis?
Installation:
Also, we need to install some NLTK corpora using following command:
(Corpora is nothing but a large and structured set of texts.)
Authentication:
In order to fetch tweets through Twitter API, one needs to register an App through their twitter account. Follow these steps for the same:
Implementation:
Run on IDE
Here is how a sample output looks like when above program is run:
We follow these 3 major steps in our program:
Now, let us try to understand the above piece of code:
to call the Twitter API to fetch tweets.
TextBlob is actually a high level library built over top of NLTK library. First we call clean_tweet method to remove links, special characters, etc. from the tweet using some simple regex.
Then, as we pass tweet to create a TextBlob object, following processing is done over text by textblob library:
Here is how sentiment classifier is created:
Then, we use sentiment.polarity method of TextBlob class to get the polarity of tweet between -1 to 1.
Then, we classify polarity as:
