48 students made it to next round which was Group Discussion.
Group Discussion Round:
The topic was “You are the technical head of an enterprise. The enterprise contains different facilities in the enterprise like labs, library, cafeteria,etc. There are 100000 employees which have different roles such as scientists, house-keeping, etc. Every person doesn’t have access to every facility like scientists have the access to labs whereas house-keeping doesn’t. So the CEO of the enterprise asked you to design a fully automatic security system which manages the security of the enterprise and track and trace the employees.”
My advice is try to speak after 2 to 3 students in your group so that you can gain some points from them and use them accordingly in such group discussions.
Finally 22 students were selected.
